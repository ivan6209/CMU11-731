but i 'm good , do n't know my day , ladies
and so , thanks to talk about this invitation to talk to the
so i have to start to imagine myself . ''
and my name is joseph , and i 'm happy to be able to eat sounds as the most difficult
now , this is what we 're called ,
and my favorite story is , first of all , this is the organization , third of the
now , i 'm going to be in the middle of this
so , you know , you do n't do it
so i know .
and that 's what happens to be , and that 's something that i really think of as i like ,
i mean , that 's the reason i 'm going to be
we 've had the right gap between
so i 've been thinking about this , of course , is a theme of what i 'm going to do with you today
and that is , by the way , the theme of mind , because it 's
and we hope to think about the best , and we tend to think about the worst one , which says , ``
i mean , they know
and he was at the top of a
so , i 'm going to start out of this thing to say so
and i 'm going to give you
and so let 's talk , if there 's a risk that we 're going to go to a moment , for example , child flu , a
i 've got a lot of
i mean , it turns out that it 's
and then on the edge of the suitcase , there 's a suitcase , brown , flat , a little bit , a
and that seems to be something that
it does n't hear a suitcase
so , a lot of
i mean , you take the
now , the police comes out , i
i 'm going to
and that 's kentucky
so , you get out
and what is we going to go ? what is
so , we do n't know that , or we ca n't say it
i mean , they 're going to
it 's crying .
and you might , some of the fall sometimes even because they need to
so , a lot of
and that 's where there 's
i mean , by a panic
so i 'm going to leave you
now , i do n't know the rest
so , it 's not a prediction that i 've made up . right ?
and that 's exactly what that happens in this week is what 's
now , this is a bit of a suitcase
and as soon as it turns out , it was only in which we had , where tens of
and the people who were just like this , and so a friend told me that came to me from the building . ''
and it was nothing that was
so it was just this time in fact , all of this time in a group , in the group , in my group , when
we did n't say , `` oh yeah . '' no , it 's not like that , and it did n't seem like
and you can see , in a way , you see , in a way , that is a good
so , of course , it 's important important because people are in this situation , of communication
so , you want to know what is going to
and at the same time , the very old time , the very old time , the old
so we do n't say anything , or we 've got a
i mean ?
i mean , that 's what 's
and you 've got to say to you , god forbid , people say to me , `` we do n't say the truth or what we do . '' but we
and that 's in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a period of facebook , in a period of family , and at the time of facebook and public health care , in a very long time , in a
and most of the time because of that , because of course , is not an important thing , and second , we are n't the same as important to
so , you might remember , at the bedside rate in the hudson river , it 's a couple of times a year
and the first one was about coming from twitter
so for someone who was on a treadmill at the top and the tail , in the same time , and they would sit down , and there was a
i did n't have any research
and you can see , we 're going to see that , of course , we 're just tracking , and just like , to the truth
and yet , of course , we are also the last ones that know that , because of the reasons , because of course , as we need to deal with , of course ,
this is public media , or not private media , or not as well , or they do n't just do it . they
and so that 's where we 're going to eat in , and that 's also something that has been around with the media , that we think about how we 're going to think about
and that 's where we 're going to do the old age of
so it 's just as though the form of
and this is where we 're going to take about a hundred years old in the back of the building , which are some of you who are familiar with , you know , some of you who
so for that , it was
and you may know , you know , as three times , once a long time , just a long time , and at
so , i do n't know it
and we 're going to talk about all the time today that we have on with this point where we have on this one , so we 're talking about facebook , on the television and the local media and so on , and immediately , connected with all the time , the local media and so forth , with just being able to get the information to the information .
and we know , we have to deal with a lot of quickly and urbanization , and we need to think about it , and we need to deal with a lot of attention ,
so , we do n't expect to believe that what we want to say . we
so , in the crisis , or in a catastrophe , is a question of design all over the media that is available to us , and it 's also a question of what 's a little bit
in fact , our greatest problem is because of our leaders and citizens are going to say , and the people who do n't know , they do n't get the old ones , but they say , `` all the time we do , '' it 's
and so we 've done a lot of experiences with facebook and twitter , and that 's a
so , you may , you know , maybe you 've got some of them
now , we 've had a bigger set of food in food
and so that 's an example of a
now , these are 20,000 bombs that are being scanned with a 401 plan , because they do n't really look at the top of the chemical and on the ground , and they do n't even know on the floor in the united states and not only on the ground , and they would say , there 's a bunch of people out there who would be there , and then it 's got a blast . it 's
i mean , the problem is only , a lot of the staff has never worked , and then after that , at the same time in
and there 's been a parent called `` the age of marriage , '' which is so nice to the unicorn , '' he said , `` well , we 'd seen it , and he 'd seen it , we 'd seen it , '' he 'd seen it , and he 's already discovered , and he 's informed the authorities
and since the end , there 's a number of times confused by all
i 'm going to show you what we find all of that
so , these bombs have got to go inside the place , not necessarily , but they
and so , in fact , we used to go to the park , and in fact , we 're just going to do some of the
so , in the history of the city , all the communications models over facebook , and all the time , with the fact that the entire industrial developed world 's developed very far away from
so , the media was very excited . i 'm going to
so , we did n't even have to go up with the bbc , but they had the same thing , and we were
and the whole thing has been a great effect for us , because the way that you 're going to do is reduce
so , that 's why i 'm going to give you a sign when i stop . i
now , i ca n't show up here at the watch .
so this is the kind of thing , because of that , that social media has the advantage that they 're very different to
and so that is n't very , very shocking , because the people who are out there 's enough , or the way that they call them , a
and the second thing is ,
and if you do n't feel that , even if you do n't know , that 's what the polar bear is , by the way that i 'm just talking about , that 's where the whole community is based on
and it 's a very high app that 's so high , so if anything is wrong , then it can also be very fast . ''
and we 've got a huge amount of
so i said yes , i said , `` well , that became an amazing thing that would be considered to be a
so , from that , we have been out of all the things that have been happening in the last few years , and it 's much more relevant to them as a result of how it 's a
now , the city of food can go to this day is going to be described to
and it 's not a bomb that 's going to be in the city that has to be in the
and you can also see , and also , by the way , we 're going to be able to be found in the center of the room , and then we sit there with our neighboring
so , if you think about it , you think of other cities , if you want to get cities , if you 're going to get rid of the world , you 've got a name that you can not have to be able to say , you know , `` you know , are n't going to be a few
and to communicate that , of course , is that it 's actually working in one of the world of food consumption , to try to stop translating technology to do research , to make sense of people who are able to pay attention to people who are able to do this in a difficult situation . to do it in a lot of situation . to do this very well . ''
and the social media , we 're also going to be the way of life , because if you 're all of the communication , and it 's not just a world war that we have , and it 's not just a catalyst of how we put this in , and also , even in the
in fact , today , not only is a task of the authorities today , not just a design of the law , or by the curb , the capitol bus , the communications grow , and communication of communication , and it 's a catastrophe going to us all of us
and this is what dan showed up
and yet , on twitter , and about facebook , a lot of the help , if there 's still a lot of help , you know , if you wanted to build a smaller person , you know , they were n't going to be the
and this is because there 's a lot of work to do , but it 's for public communication in the middle class , but it 's just shown that the social media is made out of communication , from the communication of a furniture that 's not going to be out of the way . that
and i hope that i believe that this is that i believe that this medium that is really important for the beautiful things that are really used to the beautiful things that are really used to the beautiful things of life , even though it is the same with the beautiful things of life , even in the same time , and now i 'm really comfortable with her attention , even if you 've never seen the same time in the same time . '' if you 've never seen the same time . you 've never seen the same time . '' at the same time . '' i 've never
so , thank you
and here 's a beautiful good evening .
now , i 'm a different
so , i 'm a writer , and i 'm just like , you know
and i 'm also going to do one now to go on to your own point .
so , what it is , i 'm going to make it up there , i 'm going to make you
and before i do that , i 've got to do that , but i
i mean , the first one , i think , is that we need to really share with
i mean , we could not be able to
and i also think that there 's also a lot more powerful , more , more stories , more stories , of course , in fact , in
and then i think that the internet , which means that the internet , which is , despite all , how much of that is as good as
and four , i 'm not convinced that people have been used to be creative , to be creative .
so that they are happier , as they 're going to be creative .
now , the more people are happy , the better part of it is the
i mean , sure
now , the better world is now , only is a protein
so , the first line , i 'm like , is writing , writing
and the story that i want to tell you , is going to go down again , instead of going to go into something that is just
i mean , that 's
i mean , it 's a little bit
and then they get out of the ups and the very simple thing that 's going to do so much , because at the moment it 's going to happen again , something about you .
and it 's something that you can see something in your head in your body , with
and it 's not really good for this .
so , you do n't know what 's going on
and i have words for that ,
so , i 'm going to call that the
and you can see on the side of the page , and it 's in black , and everything
so , i 've got a bit of a bit of a bit
we 've got
and on the other hand , we have the one of the people in the united states with a lot of
so i said , `` well , you know , i 'm going to make it too , and i 'm like i 'm
so , the first thing that is , what is going on with her new perception is a dead man with a male hair , and she 's very serious about telling you , really nice , your life is over . it 's over . it 's
i mean , that 's
and so , at the same time that i 'm talking about , you know , they 've heard of
so , she was born as a
and you are human beings who have been playing out of their careers in the process of
i mean , who 's kind of
so , very nice
and if you 're going to do that , you do n't put yourself in the 1920s , not only if you 're going to do
and so , over and , you know , copper , all
i mean , really , what 's important about , the players have no idea on
so we know , we do n't know when we die .
so , i do n't have a long life , but we do n't know that
now , it can also be over the course of
and so , it 's kind of , to me , i
so , you know , you do n't know at all , how much you
i mean , that means , `` every doctor may have been the last one
and one of the players who got his own life , but at the moment of the limb like a spotlight , that 's going to
and so , of course , you can ask , if this is so dangerous , that 's so dangerous , why do
and the answer is very clear : that 's
and yet , without a play , without the killing of you , and all the gray , and if you 're a player , it 's actually
so , they were born in a
and that 's
in fact , that 's from history , and as you now , the world of the player , and they look at their first challenges , they have the first challenges that they have , first of all of us
so , in a form of an eye
now , the first phase of education has 12 characters , richard , i 've been , here 's an amazing point that i 've ever been
so , over the course of 12 , in the first bead , with a thousand of five or seven
and this kind of thing that is given to the other objections , a consequence of the other , thank you
so that television does n't make anything out of his
so that 's not new .
i mean , if it would be anything , i 'm going to go over here
i do n't even know here .
and now , that 's just going to go
so let 's go back to the back of
and what is the most famous sentence out of the movie or a series ?
and it can only give you a one ,
so , thank
and as if we had to do that
so that 's exactly what i 'm not going to do with the
i mean , there are going to be a lot
i 've got a lot of different games
so let 's think about it , at least , for example , health , water , etc . so
and that 's exactly what 's going to be the number of players
and so , there are lots of stories that are all going to tell all of
and now , the next question is : who 's going to tell you all
so , i 've been , i 've got a very high opinion
so , i think , `` i know , to be honest
and i know that a lot of brains are more complex than just one , but that 's mine . ''
we 've been looking at the idea that you 've got to be able to look at the same process of
and if , what if we did n't just take away , or if that 's what we do
and as you say , we 're going to take you all of you , really , to put this into this kind
and for example , for example , as a result of three , an amazing thing that you find in fact is to find you that , because he was talking about her grandfather . ''
so , you know , you 're a big fan
and so , you can just do this , with technology , you do n't get much more difficult to do this , but it 's
and then i 'm going to leave you with the air in the middle of the room , where it comes right , and that 's the really cool stuff that is
i mean , it 's not somewhere out there , but it 's going to go somewhere in the bottom of where it 's
so , the real beautiful thing is that we 're in the internet
now , in the internet , you can do all the things
so , of course , it 's kind of
and that 's what they want to write them in , as a result , write like , what you want to do
now , if we look at this , again , again , we
and you can see this little bit of the web , right
and that 's what 's going to be built out
so , i 'm really bothered to believe that the internet was born , to tell you the kind of stories of the stories . ''
now , it does n't even have a lot of things , it does n't
and now i 'm going to go now , and i 'm going to go through the audience itself , and i 'm going
i mean , it 's a
and then you can go to the articles from the building , but also , people who are also interested in the real environment themselves , that they 've also
and in addition to that , you know , that 's what you 've been familiar with , all of them are very good , like something
and these are areas that are going to be very rapidly in the
so , that 's not where i can go , because i would need to go back to you
so what we do is we
i mean , every one time is going to share
and the first part is the most exciting one , the second part of the earth is , and then we have the
and by the way , i could do the top of the keyboard , i think the thing that i 'm going to do is to take
and i 've given the first prize for the first time in the best
and i have to say , this is not enough of the ice tags from the fruit , from the food supply , and so on
and so , i have a lot of people
and if i can convince the reason , this is the internet , but actually , i 'm going to use the structure right now to use existing structures , by the world , by the time , i
and that 's
so , if you are , `` well , is that all this stuff is
that 's because of all of us in the name of all the
and of course , what we have , of course , is that the player is , who is it , i 'm just , you 're
it 's like that , then
so , in fact , it 's going to be
i mean , every one of them is , everybody has to die
so , of course , everybody is , everybody 's going to be able to give up the sense of every day if he
so that 's really important to me
and i 'm going to go from this , and there is nothing worse than my opinion , when it 's going to be a bit
so , i do n't know if you know that
now , when you 're in the theater , and then the actor 's like this , and it 's like , in god , and god is ,
we do n't know that . that 's
i mean , it 's got some
i do n't need to
now , it can also be the audience ,
and the reason i 'm saying is that the whole thing that 's going to be in edinburgh , which is going to be
i mean , there 's a couple of
so i went to this project , and i went back to that time , and i said , i 'm always going to go back to english , all of this
so , i can only tell you , the german world is the world 's largest energy
this is the english election , then it 's the prime minister , and it 's the
and it 's not going to be the same way that we 're going to do in a small
so in fact , i really think of really , if it really means people will be grateful for me , that people are going to be grateful for some of the things that they have n't really be done with any kind of thing in the end of each one of
and if that 's all going like this , how i would like to do it , the first variable now is going to be the first
and if you 're thinking , `` well , as i 'm going to ask you why i 'm here today , where you 're here at the top of the
now , i 've been trying to do a couple of things
so , i love pun
so it 's not only
so , i 'm also very close to about how you 're
and that 's a couple of a research that was
so , i can just say , this whole thing is incredibly important , and it 's incredibly important to
and it does n't use it , you do n't do anything if you do
so my project is just a little bit more challenging where i 've just got to know what i 've been doing to do
i 've had it in there
i 'm going to do that now
and so , i can just say
so , if you think , if someone thinks that i want to be my part of my mind , i have been an idea of character , or i did n't know , i 'm going to be able to get a little bit of what
and we already have a look at the
it 's on facebook
we 've got to speak , like , the
and i 'm going to say , ``
and so welcome to , can you skim memories ?
this is what you want
so , can you go to
and if you remember , you know , you know what 's going to happen in your life
so , you know , have you
i mean , who 's going to remember that anybody ? remember
i do n't want to go into
and you can spray memories , you
and it turns out
it 's very much
so , you do n't , that 's not what we do n't want
now , the point of that would be pretty
and so , a night evening , my name is senator ,
so i talk to this talk today , which i did , because i 'm going to give it two minutes of my passions , or my
and i 've been sitting in the process that i 've been doing now , and i 've been doing with the bits and valleys that i 'm going to go through the world and
so , even a little bit of time , i 'm also going to give up as an artist and a
and what 's a little bit of me on the computer is very busy at the computer that i 'm talking about in the human side , so how does it work , and how does it work the human behavior ? human , how does it work ?
now , how do you change that ?
i mean , let 's take a
and i 've been recently in a very interesting discussion of research on the intelligence of artificial
and the question was , when do we know when , how can we build a computer model that is like the human brain ? how ? what can human
and so , and so , and i 'm like , `` well , we 're
and i 'm going to say that two , a hundred million years , longer , that 's not
and so , let me do that , why you do this , why may have a little bit
and the relationship between the computer on the computer , and the brain is on the other side of the
and if we take the computer , you can all do it , you 're going to make you , your search engine , and you can all have these cameras , and all of these things , and
and he 's called the `` spelling spider , ''
we 're going to put those parts of the
and the word that has already heard of each other , and it 's always going to be so much
and so the little bit of computational fluid dynamics , which has three columns , and that 's not
and in our computer , in our computers , we 've been doing that , by the way , i used to say about a hundred
so you 're going to go ahead and
so we 're doing things , we 're doing things , we 've got things we 've done , we 've seen words , and we 've never described to say , `` we can hear a great deal , very quickly , but actually , he
and it 's going to be
so , in fact , it 's
so , let 's compare it to the brain to
so our brains have been a particle , which is the neuron , and it 's also , i 've got a billion billion , and we have a billion billion neurons in our gray numbers in that number one in the
so , the beautiful thing is , of our neurons , we do n't only have these connections , and that 's what we have
i mean , this is what a lot of times is , it 's just because it 's beautiful ,
i mean , that 's 10 with 10,000 zeroes
so , you know , you know , the complexity of our brain is to be a different higher than what we 're doing as computers . if
and if we want to see the driver 's creation , or maybe one of the first teams , the first teams , the first teams , which had their own brand on the front door , & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; /em
so the way we do sometimes , like , we 're burning , like the middle , you
and that 's the thing , and that 's the thing that is the equivalent of two big bananas , so more , you do n't need them , and you
and what we 're doing now is that there 's a bit of a little bit of a bit here there , you know , there 's a little bit of a little bit
and perhaps the one thing that you see , or another of those who live in the internet , such as the human use is only 10 percent of his brain , `` you 're going to be
and then there 's a little bit of consistency to me ,
so , if you ca n't have 10 percent , but our brains are in the evolution of the evolution of this evolution , that was a little bit blurred in the mass of this , and that 's actually a little bit in the middle , that
so that 's not what we 're not going to do is to use
and what does it seem to say , is that we 're going to take the largest
i mean , you know , maybe you know the
so , as i 'm going to say , by the way , as you can see the squid in the sea , it 's the top , it 's coming down here , it 's going to be a snake down , it 's
and that 10 percent on the top , which is the same thing that is , which is the same , which is the same , which is the same , which is the same , which is what our
and so what we do is that we 're going to do this , like we 're going to do the
and as you go to that memory , you 're going to go back to this memory , maybe the one or other people
so , you know , people who have n't had a little bit further in the same way that i 've never seen before , and i would n't have seen in the situation , and then i 'm saying , `` well , how do you know ? ''
and so , there 's a special , there 's a special , an example , which is one of them , like , on a treadmill , which is a little bit awkward , which is a little naive memory , so that 's a little bit awkward memory , so that 's a little bit awkward memory , so that 's a little bit awkward memory , which is a little sad memory , which is a little sad memory , which is a little bit awkward memory , so that 's a little naive memory , and he 's got a little sign memory , and he 's starting to draw from a bold sign , and
and this is what this is like , and this is `` no , '' and that 's `` no , every single house , every single house , he 's got a little bit of paper , he was able to go back to paper again . '' he
that 's where do we do
and why ca n't that , why ca n't we do that , well , that 's not true , because it 's likely to be even more likely to differentiate more than your breast cancer , that
and now we do n't use it , but perhaps we 're not wondering why that 's not going to remind me at the ted conference at night , in
and so , you know , i 've made a lot of time
so he was working with the idea of working with the working room , and they worked with a computer program that was their fault , that was n't more comfortable with the brain , that 's not the subject of the brain , which is not just that
i mean , it 's very clear to think of
so , now , it 's been done to do the people who make
and so she 's got a very safe way to go into this room , even if you could n't find out there , that you could n't be able to be able to remember that the back of the car , that if you could n't be able to see the control of the car , that would not be able
so , in fact , that has been taken to the plate of the
and the second thing i 've been really amazing was , he got a lady in school that was told that their mother had told him is that her mother told her father was on her feet in her , when she was small , and
so , she was sitting on the weekends of her mother and her mother , read
and then she said , `` in her , '' she said , `` well , ''
and then she started out , and she was four times the same thing that she did , but you could n't read it , today , you can
and then they said , they 're going to tell me the other ones , say ,
and you actually , one of the images that you saw in the favela in the middle of the text , which is the lady with the text that
and the brain has been the one that it was , as it is , as an
and then they could read it
and in fact , we actually have access to it , but we 've actually have access to life in the normal world that we do n't have to think of ourselves , to
and yet , we 're not going to do that , but we do n't have the event , but like , like , what he shows , what is going on , you see what we feel about , if you look at what you feel like , what you 're doing , the same thing that we do , you know , if you look at what you 're doing , the same thing that we do , you know , if you look at it , you see what 's going on , you see what we feel about , if you look at what 's going on , you
so , it was a long long evening , a little bit long evening , but you 're going to go back , `` well , you can ask me , `` you know , then you 'll ask me , you know , just
and remember , if you think about a very pragmatic , special event in the past past , yes .
i mean , let 's first get the first
so , if you 're going to do that , you might be able to get a little bit of a visual part of that memory
so , you might have a picture , maybe even a movie ?
so , some of the things are not just going to do that , because we do this as normal as well , but they 're going
now , if you can see that , you can be able to be able to see that you 're either going to be in the movie that you 're going to see your eyes , or how you
i mean , this is what we call `` the other ones
and thank you very much , you 're going to solve the idea of the same 19-year-old to
and who 's going to have a visual information , a little hand ?
and so , there 's a little bit about the hands of a pair of hands , so that 's as true as i would say , yes , this is about what i expected , it 's actually something that we 're going to do , that 's actually what we do so that it does n't take us in the first moment
so , let 's go ahead and go
and what is beautiful is because in terms of memories , it 's not just about this memory , it 's not just about this memory , it 's not just about that memory , you know , it 's beautiful , because if you 're laughing , you know , you know , you know , that 's pretty much , because if you 're doing something , or with no memories , or we can do with our memories , or other emotions . '' or other things
so , that 's what 's happening
i mean , everything that was all about before , yes , well , the way that our brain does n't make any difference between what we actually saw is what you 're going to do , and what we actually do
in fact , you can try to go back home , and you can look at them in the future that has n't happened , and you 'll see similar things like this , if you remember something about what happened in the last one . it was . in fact ,
and , you know , you know , those are the stories that you 're going to talk to you in front of the time
so the time , you know , that 's the thing , and that 's because it was so beautiful , and the longer just had a lot , and the same thing was so beautiful , and the longer just had a lot of things , and most of the time they were much more often , and the longer just had a lot more popular , because there was a
and if we do that in the dressing room , so if we actually do our memories look like this , you know , we 're going to change our memories ,
so , when i came here , when my uncle sees me an image , from his wallet in switzerland . switzerland . '' in
and it 's also a beautiful beautiful picture , it 's also a beautiful ,
so the picture is , `` well , little bit more beautiful than the wheels , so it 's an exaggeration , '' it 's an attempt to do , because the sun is located in the alps , which is quite an image of that knife , not only a part of me . '' no . '' i do n't . '' of course . i 'm not an honest . '' no . '' to
and why do n't we do this with our own thoughts , our own memory , yes , so what happens to me if i do the same thing , what i think is i think ? i think about that ?
so , in fact , you have a freedom of freedom to
and so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
now , i did n't have sex in my own dad ; i would have lost all the
i mean , all of the night , and this thought did n't get me
and i do n't think it 's the way that i did n't do the
so , my son , he had a little bit depressed for him , when he was going to germany , and he had his mother in his chest , and he was just
so what the father did , so he did every night with his son and he said , what was the most important thing that 's going on today ? what happened ? what is happening today ? what happened ?
so what was the most interesting thing to say , and then he 's got to talk to him , and he 's going to tell him what he 's going to talk about today , which is
i mean , on two weeks , it was the son of the
and then it was also okay right now that the whole thing that 's going to get out of it comes back to
i mean , it 's the only reason that i 've been here today , and the whole thing about it , is one of the most successful people i
so , it 's not the memories that we 're going to affect us , and it 's our focus on what we 're going to do , and what we 're going to do about our
and how much energy we 're going to do is
and so , if you look at your crappy thoughts , or say , that 's the thing that i 'm talking about , you know , you do n't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to say , `` well , you 're good , '' now you 're going to do , you know , you 're going to do , but you 're going to go wrong , get out of it . '' so he 's going to go through it . '' so he 's going to go through it . '' so he 's going to go through it . '' he
and so what we do , but what we 're doing is , what we do , oh , as we speak , ah , yeah , yeah , it 's a little bit like , `` oh , yeah , i mean , i
so , do you do that .
we can do with them with her , and let 's put them on the
and if you 're someone who gets stolen , you know , it 's the power of your boss , or your wife , or her husband , you 're laughing for yourself .
and so , take a picture , you 're going to put it in a funny way , please .
and so , you know , at the top of the morning , on the side of the car , you 're laughing ,
and what they do is to say , because they 're funny ,
and you can do a lot better than the situation of all of
and then he 's going to be
so , no , i think our brains have to be so much of capacity to be able to
and it does n't matter , because we can choose free , like us , we 're going to focus on , and how important it is , of course , how important it is , of course , as
so , to me , you know , play with the images in your head , use the images of your body , and give you the power of your body , and give them a day of life that
so , okay . so
so , thanks for inviting us .
and i 'm asked to a friend , what i 'm going to do with my mind , and i say that , i 'm going to go back to some music , and then i look up with friends , and then i look up with my friends , and then i look like i 'm going to
and so when i cut down , it 's a little bit reminiscent of english music , and it 's a bit of an english scientist , and it 's just like , in fact , that they 're sitting in very remote places , and they 're very proud of art .
and as a result of that , when you talk about music , is like crazy about this thing
so that 's how we 're doing as the kind of thing that we do
so , you know , you 're going to have a glimpse of what i 'm talking about to you about
this is
and that 's a little bit of a
i mean , that 's what it comes from my view on the point
and at the heart rate , this is how it turns out that it 's sort of like the
and we 're now , we 're hardwired to be in between here and in the middle of the end of the middle of the end , and finally left , and i 've been very
and also , we 've also seen that the solar center of the jungle , and of course there 's some joy , and we have some mistakes ,
so , of course , what i 'm sure is that the so-called crisis in the science of the music is not based on the content , so on the music itself , but also
and so let 's take a question , like , how can we create a more profitable way of music , the friends and the power are going to be so much like you . so you can do it . ''
and how can we create a draft that go beyond the very beginning of the university of
and so we 're going to have the spectra that you can see from the classic white , room , time , light , context , it 's
so , for example , we can take the relationship between the ages
i mean , there 's between the stage between the stage and the audience
i 'm going to try to
and here 's a picture of what we 're going
so , the musicians are sitting in the audience , put a beer , a lot of the people who are talking about , the ones are playing , two pieces , go back into the audience
i mean , this is going to be a little bit in the
and everybody 's coming out , you 're going to go back to the stage , and
so you 're going to go in
and in the red rock , it is that you 're more likely to be more or less painful , more assertive , more assertive , you 're sitting there , and it 's listening to
and so there are music , and you can actually do n't even sit at all
and so we 've done a thought of how to do that , and that
and if you 're sitting in and you can sit on a piece of music , you can hear a little bit of music
so , in fact , at the concert , we have n't had an stage , four , four o'clock around the audience . ''
so the audience could have been able to
and so , at the moment , every time in the front row ,
and what 's important for us is that we do n't just have to do n't just kind of have done it , but that 's
and so , that 's why we 're asking , who are , and , how are we going to do that , and also , in the way , are we going to be the music
and so , by the way , this is where you go through in the morning when you 're going to do 30 o'clock in the morning , which is the only ones that are actually
and it 's not just the spaces where it 's going to be able to turn the music and all the wires are going to be able to
and so that 's how happy we 've been working with a few years ago , that we 've been working with the idea of working with us , and we 're working with social justice system that actually did n't have written with paper .
and then you can get up , or by the way , for example of view , from
and in this year , we 've got us to do that , yes , if you want to be
and so , for example , we 're going to have a concert with a
so , we have the story of the military soldiers with thermal education , food , and also , to get married and to be a
and so , that 's all done about that , because we 've got a big driver of railways that we 've used to do in
and so we 've done about a lot of money from people out of germany , so that we could do this in the
so , in fact , this is something that is kind of a way of
so , you know , we 've got quite happy to look at the same time in the middle ages of
so , the city is exactly the size of which we are private spaces and exciting places for south africa , but also quite small , that we do n't know
and when the first of the year in the 1970s , two years in the spring of the united states of europe in the city , it turns out that the world is more likely to get more than
i mean , all of that power is
so we are a recreational mixture of students from students and students , government , human rights , heart disease , transportation , all of that small
so , to take a look at a representative system , which is that the kind of loss that you would , and so that 's going to be able to go out and take a look at the eye , and then
and in fact , it 's also , because you spend a year for a year , for instance , for example , for example , the most expensive ones in your hands are also to be used to
so , all of us in our leisure and we live in all of our country
and that is , the largest part of the work comes in , and it 's a
so , over three year , we 've talked to you over the year in a year class , south africa , talking to the problems that have taken up , and in fact , this is really important , if you want to do something that you 're going to think of something like that . if
and at the end of the day , after all the time , i get to spend 20 to 30 and a half weeks of the rest of your help , and then you have to help where you 're going to be able to do when you go
and of course , we 're going to come out of these days
and so , you might , you know , you could have everything you 've got to do anything
and we 're going to go back to
so what we have , in fact , we 've got in the middle of a new community around us around the world that we want to do what we
and so this is what 's called `` the rejection collection , '' which is also about all sorts of things to be the most important thing , '' so that 's a nonprofit , which gives us a bread that makes us with bread , or for a
and it 's used to be used in a field of life in the city , and he 's going
so , at the same time ,
so we 've found a whole bunch of people who have been able to put together in their living room so that they can give it to the
and in that kind of , and it 's used to be a way to be able to get into that city , and that is going
and you 're looking at a very special way of doing this , and it 's
and at the beginning of the year , we were able to help us share with support aid from the citizens in the united states , which is the whole thing that has been doing in a
i mean , we 're talking about the general election , that `` music music is , '' you know ,
and so that 's why we 're incredibly happy about that in europe , we call music music in their own hand , and at home in the cities , they 're
and if you ca n't be able to be able to imagine how you might be able to look at exactly what 's going to think , say , `` music , '' you
so in the next year , we 're going to go back , and we 're going to look back if they 're there
i mean , know , ladies and gentlemen , learn
so , you may think of a
so , you know , to learn , to the importance of learning , but i do n't want to learn the amount of learning , but i 'm happy to learn to you even more
and you know , even the experience of mind , a nice little bit of
and what i 've learned to art and culture , now , i can find a lot of of this , and i think , of course , i 'm going to say a lot
and so that 's why i 've thought that it might be right , that this guy is going to be a little bit of what i 'm talking about . ''
and it 's beautiful , but it 's beautiful ,
this is also what you 've heard
so you 're going to know the laughter , you know , most of the
what is that ? is that
and i think it 's going to do with this , that in the word beautiful thing , which is that we can not be able to do
i mean , you know , art , we also say , `` well
and at the same time , we 're going to say , ``
you know , even
i mean , the people who want to work with that , which is what
and at the same time , we think , at the same time , we know , to think , to the art , and the art is really about to the realm beyond the realm beyond the realm of
and so that 's what i 've been trying to give you today , which is , in three hours , five , in three months to four years that i have all the wheels , and with me , that 's very easy for it .
and it begins with the back of the room for childhood childhood , and it 's going to happen to my youth , i 'm not going to tell you all of my youth , i 'm not worried about my youth , i 'm not worried about mine , i 'm going to give all the
and the interaction for the first part of my life in my mind , and then finally ,
and so , one of them will be able to know that these pieces of `` little
so , you know , two and
so you learn it in the first two , three years ago , if you 're going to search and you 're trying to learn .
and so with 10 , six , i put these little pieces of pieces , and on the piano , which is n't far from them to go home at home .
so these are the ones that have been
so it 's got a piece of paper and the other voice , but it 's very different .
and it 's in the foreground , and it 's the same ,
and i mean , ladies and gentlemen , is something that is essential to the art , that when it 's only two voices , i started to think that only is the same , the same , the kind of thing to do , and if it 's only two voices , things like that , and in fact , things like this , which is , in fact , this is true of art . it 's art . it
and i have learned that , by some time , two things sometimes sometimes , sometimes three times , in the same way , to play the same way , to play the same way that we 're trying to
i mean , that 's what i 've learned in the other way . ''
and what i did is another experience , and i 've been able to do that there was something that i could possibly be able to do
now , i 've got some research ; it was more people in the room than i 'm here today , and in the middle of it , i
so i had forgotten it .
now , i 've got it
so , again , we started out , and on the same hand , i did n't go
so the audience has more and more than i said , as i went to go to my neck on my room , i got out of my notes , and then the third time , from the
and you do n't think the way that i 'm going to give up
so this was a very heavy experience to do
and that was also an idea of what i knew , and i 'm going to do with them , by the way , that i could n't really have my email address , because if you can talk about it , you can get easier to
so , the next thing i 've been talking about is what i 'm talking about , and also , i want to tell you stories .
and when i was so amazed , i went to my desk , and i said , `` mom , i 'd like to say , `` i 'd like
and he said , `` oh , that wo n't do that
so , you 've got to have to have a lot of have taken over and have a lot
and then you 're going to start with a second young boy , so , a young boy , so , a sentence
now , i do n't forget that .
i mean , from that point , of course i 've got more
now , i was at the end of it , and i went to
now , i 've been doing , and i remember a situation that i 've never seen my way out .
so it was a little bit of the complications from the hill , and now i 'm going to do the same thing , and it 's actually not a thing , and it was just a little bit of control , and it was just a little bit of control , and it was a little
and i 'm not going to play it , not a piece of paper , and i could n't do it . '' i could
so i 've been here , and then i 'm going to take this one , 30 times
and then they went on , and then i sat down , and i was sitting in a television show , and i just had a lot of myself , and i just knew i 've always on the
now , i was there .
and i did n't have a drink , none of all , and the music had done that i was
and one of the things i learned how i 've learned how to do is
and sometimes it 's also right , it 's actually right , it 's actually going to work out in this sort of thing , that i call it the `` vagina monologues ''
it 's going to happen in the
so , in fact , we had this situation , also in the 1920s , in the
and then it would happen , as though , as soon as we did , and as soon as we did this , we had the first 18 months to take , and that would
i mean , that 's my connection with the piano , with my work , with a work of work
and i 'm going to go to my favorite classes , i
and i was just once again a little bit as a musician in , but
and what we 've got is , we 've got
and i 've been doing , and i 've done , and i 've done , and i 've done , and i 've been able to
so , in my state , you 're going to breathe , a very clear , wonderful experiences that i 've done , very , very
and then came out of that , where i grew up in the kind of theater theater , where the polar bear , and i would say , and i was doing this , because of this session , and i realized that this was the idea of this , and i realized that this was a part of art , and culture , and i was working with this sort of thing that is a lot of art and culture , i was also working with the job of
and so the art of the culture , to create the culture , to create my
so this is work in art , but it 's not as artists , but if you do n't , you know , you would n't say , you know , you do n't have to do
so i was there in the theater , and i 've been in the middle school , there 's a lot of educational devices in the middle of all this , and i 've come up with a question , to make art work for art , to make art a good business , to make a good job ? a good business ? '' a good job ? '' with a good job ? to get a good
and that was the reason that i 've been , in fact , i 'm going to be in my work , in the way , and i 'm going to go out and be
so , at the same time , another thing that was different , and that 's where i 've
and i said , `` well , i
so , the german minister of its nose was in
so , i 'm a journalist , though , sometimes i 'm in my heart , because i was born at all , and i was born at all the time that i was born at all , i know ,
now , i have a national root root , because my grandparents were used to have the most beautiful , and there , in there , i 've seen it . i
and it was really interesting about what i did n't know anything about what i did n't know so , and suddenly , i was in a different form of culture , in a sense of culture , in a culture of life , in a culture that was lived in people in
and as soon as the street back in front of us , all of us were in a whole situation , and in
and so , i 've been building , i used to go with high school principals , which is the most powerful and personal and who was my friend and colleague , and so that 's what we 've done with my friend and colleague , and then i 've made a music , for example , i could blow up
and so , we did n't have the dawn of the land , so , of course , we did the lyrics ,
i mean , this one , which i think was really about the people
so it was my fate that i grew up in the south bronx , i used to talk to me , and i did n't know that the wall was
and i was at the next day , i had a little bit skeptical , oh , the wall is like , yes ,
and in short , i 'm afraid for some of those questions , in some
so , of course , i used to be the south coast of the cities
we 've seen over again , as a result of how it 's going to be in between three
so , in fact , we 're the same language , the music will be there , and it 's wonderful , but a lot has been done
and as a result , it was a lot of the people , but it came out of the things , but it 's a lot of the top , and i got a lot of the top , and that 's a lot of the top , and it 's got lots of times , and that 's a lot of the top , and i got a lot of
now , germany , is germany ,
and since then , in the process , there 's a lot more
and then i have learned , and then i 've been able to do some of these things , and
and what we did , i mean , what we did , i mean , what we did was , by the way , i 've had one of those things , and if you 've found this , you
i 've got there . i
and so she was for her , for her kid , to do with you , to
now , i was the first shot of the first
and so , i have n't been so much , so it 's amazing that i 've gone up with this , but it turned out to be because i 've been able to make it in education and so forth to education and so forth to
and what we 've done a lot of the research , we 've seen it , and if you can see that of the carbon footprint , it 's , you know , what you 've done , you can see it , you know , what you have to do with the prefrontal cortex , where you can find different between and
in fact , a lot of interactions , we could design , and i could design it , and i realized , and i realized , and i realized , and then what that means , when
so , by the way , i think i 'm going to be more connected to the art of life , and more of the culture that comes to us from the human being , the cultures , the cultures , and cultures , in the face , and i 'm going to go back to the art
and then also , then also , i think , by the way , the theme of the subject was , as we did , for example , six , the nobel prize for the first year , the
and this last chapter , this is a second chapter , which is exactly what the
and i think that word , `` you know , '' which i have to talk to something , '' which i can relate to something , and i can use it , because i 'm going to use it , because i 'm going to use it , because
and that 's always on his belly in
so , i know a little bit of his favorite thing , which is , i say , i 'm clapping or the
and i 'm talking to something that if i 'm talking to me and say to me , and say , that 's what i want to do with you
so this is a very big thing to do .
now , i 'm going to spend three million three million people in the world , to cities , to cities , to cities , to see cities , to recognize , and realize that you have a
and as big as we got this , we 've got to call it , as a community of a lot of people who live in a big emergency room , but in fact , a lot of people who live in a big emergency room , even though we 're the most powerful language , and we were also asked to have a common language to
and for the signs , the driver of the highway , the highway . ''
and so , the experience of the mountain industry did n't have so many people
and then , in 2002 , eating food food , food schools , working schools , worked with young girls ' friends , from the ted institute , a young physicist , from the ted conference , and young girls , to go back to one of his papers , `` love , '' the home of the christ , love , death , the people who wrote the last letter
and it was already a remarkable effect , that young girls call the letters that boys are writing letters to young people , and boys sending out of young people in germany , something like
and then , one of these young men coming up with the piano , and he made this kind of thing i loved
and then he comes out of a letter , and i said , `` i 'm drunk , '' he wrote home when he was home , as young german , he claimed that he was playing , and i ca n't play a little bit , because my favorite ones are just in
and he was wearing his finger with a button , put it on the piano in his book , and he was trying to play the panties . '' to play
so it did n't do it .
so it was for me that i was kind of like that at the scene that i went to come back to visit , and i said ,
and what we 've learned to do is that we have learned that a lot of people can contribute something , but before all of us , we 've learned all of the things that we 're living in school and peace culture , and so that we can talk about different languages , that we can talk to each other of us , and we can learn to each other and ourselves
so that was for me an amazing experience , and you can see , it 's not just about learning what is just about , to learn
and it 's always going to happen to be some kind of thing to get and to
and when i invent a lot of invention and invention , it 's , when we take it to work , when we communicate it with art and culture , in our own identity , we 're going to work with art and culture , then we have won . we have won . '' we 've won . '' then we 've won . in fact , we have won . '' we
and i hope that you 've got lots of lots and lots of people , and you 've got to get out of
it 's very much
so , thank you very much
and i think we 're going to wait for the first picture of
now , i 've got to pay for a research on my front door to some of the
and there 's no scientific research on it , but it 's in my favorite point , and i 'm talking about a theme here , and i 'm talking about a theme here , where i think , that will happen to take our
and as i 'm going to do , you know , what i 'm going to do now is , i 'm thinking about ted , which is also what we 're talking about here ,
and then i 've heard that , if you might think of looking at this talk in english , if somehow possible you can see , if you can look at english , i do n't know what to say in english , i did n't know what i should say , and so i did n't talk to about this one , '' and i did n't talk to that .
this is how we 're going
and i 've got to tell you very first about
and i was a patient who was in the hospital in which i had the most flexible , and it
and she was over the years old , and i always wanted to be in the way that may be thought of your husband , because you think that 's the first man , the one man , who was
and that 's how she went to the first few days and dance , and in fact , a long time , and you would have a heart attack too much , and if you 're going to do , you know , and then you go and here 's on the right side , you know
and for a few years before , she was also once , and she was in the same way of thinking about that , had left out on the left leg
and then , at that time , i was there as a doctor and a series , and i found myself in the way that i had been treated for tens of smallpox , and then the discussion came out , and then did this physical sense of that trying to make sense
so , is it going to make sense of how old people used to be able to figure out this
and so , to conclude , at the end of us in the morning , is this one of the
and it 's been estimated it had been
but five years later , i come up to the clinic , i see the name of the names , and i just ca n't know , and he 's just so rare at the time , because he 's only so rare at the time , and he 's just so long to
and so the question is , what is the point of what i 'm going to do when i 'm talking about what is the person to decide what is he going to go to his head , or what he does to
so that 's kind of a little bit about the theme of the
so , you can see the `` vagina monologues '' that we 're going to die
and it 's a book from the very beginning we 're going to be working on , a report on
and then , at that time , it was such that the globalization of which was really much easier to say that , well , would you have asked us , how could it work
and then you have , and you can , and you can still do this in a book today , because you 're still talking about , because it 's going to get some kind
and it 's going to be a combination of the work , and it 's also going to be a lot of more nuanced and more , more likely to think about china , which
so that , then that 's what he had to do that , in the process , to create something , something that 's more powerful , that it would become more powerful , that it would be stronger by the quality that he takes from , and that 's from the
so that , by the way , the people who were always less dependent on their jobs , and more and more of a little drug , where they were going to be about to high school , and not more about the high school system and not more about how to define themselves to define themselves .
so , if we 're building that , we 're going to have access to the online room and medical school , and of course ,
and if you look at the tv side , which doctors , mothers and teachers , and most of them , they 're the so-called `` spelling spider
now , this is not something that happens to be what 's going to be , because it 's going to be , because it 's going to be done with that , and it 's not going to be done with the person who 's not going to do , then the medical service , but the
and by that , you know , what is going to happen to be the work that is increasingly more powerful , more and more of this thought that it 's going to get its work , and with some sense that we use it with a sense of humor ,
so , a good friend of mine told me to go up , and he did n't want to do this , that was n't going to have been a passionate business plan , who was a member , and he was offered to be a
and the main ones that i 've been talking about as the same as the jar of the ladder , and it 's called , that there was more old people coming out of the hospital , and , again , back , and on the day , because of the rest of the time was n't going to know what
and then the next place is going to go to the hospital , are going to go back to the grocery store , or the ``
and that of course , that had just thought of that , even if you 've got to be able to put this in an area , i want to let myself to make sure that there 's something that you get out of that vicious cells and the way that you can
and then he was able to figure out that he was able to figure out , he was able to find out , he was able to find out the language that worked over the same thing that happened
and so it 's also going to be taken into a more
and it 's not more complex than the most important thing that is about , but you get it in a way , i 'm not going to go into it , i do n't want to go into the hospital ,
i mean , that 's going to
and in the third days , it 's kind of like the third days that is a conversation with the most playful , and the need to go , i want to go , i want to go into the hospital , or i do n't
so , the same thing that i 'm going to go through , or i do n't want
and this data is then to go to the center , and it 's the doctor in the doctor 's office , and it 's all the time cooked , and then the decision
and if we were looking at high school that 's kind of going to be in the way that , in the way that , instead of being able to talk about it , and in the end of us , and i would n't be connected , and maybe it was possible , and i would n't have training , and if you had to have a second piece of
and that 's my friend , which is where it 's in southern california , also quite much more powerful , as he wants to do with
so , in fact , that last is that most of the world today are about getting more to 85 percent of the people who do n't die at home , but in the age of people , they 're not going to die at the age of people , they 're spending more expensive , and they can do this for those who are in there , because of my perception , only produced by the way . so , instead of being true . i 'm suffering . '' instead of being true .
and so there 's a lot of people who do it in a very good way , so that there are very poor people who are building there , but if i look at the same time , and we 're going to say about the patient , and i 'm going to say to me , it 's hard for him to go there , to be honest , and it 's very hard to go into it . and it 's
and so , all of this has come from this , of course , the most exciting reasons that 's very clear , this whole thing , that all of these things , is the ability to control this force , that there are good at all , but i can do , for example , i can say , for example , i can give a family of two to two or two children . '' with two children . two children . '' with two or two children . '' with two times
and so this is not the real time , but you need two talent in the middle of life , and most importantly , it 's only enough .
and i 'm going to go through this talk as a consequence of a whole population of the same time that you want to communicate with , but it
and so , i 'm going to be able to do that , by the way , which may be copied , so that 's what we 're doing in the last place , because i have asked questions , and , as i said , ``
and that 's a little bit of the time i 'm going , and the articles on me , and i thought , a society is always using structures , also , using the structures that we see all the way in which we have in our society . in
and in the most famous article that one of the people would be , the dignity of
and the second part there is to say , of course , to protect the rise of all
and what i 'm like , sometimes a third sentence there is that there 's a single sentence inside there , which is that every single one that should have been given to protect us to protect and
i mean , that 's a way to throw away from him to that , and i 'm going to give it out to that kind of thing , and i 'm trying to get some attention to the idea of time , and then i do n't want to do something
so in the last day , of course , it 's also , but if we do n't want to ask this , we 're going to get to the
so , in fact , it 's too late ,
and finally , i 'm going to tell you that , to say , i want to say that i want to say that i want to take care about that , but finally , you have to take the issue , and if you 're going to have to be able to take care about life , it may be too late in life , i want to think about this question , i want to think about this question . i want to think
and if you think about what 's going on , you 're going to come out on the earth where you 're going to see , where you 're going to see , where you 're going to see where you 're
and here 's a book , which is pretty annoying at the top of the
and it 's the instructions , of course , i 'm the friends of the kids , and i 'm going to share with you all the time that i know and learn how to do it with me alive , and that 's the most
and i 'm sure that it 's the trust between people who i have to do , or in the middle of space , or a kind of a sense or a certain , or another , or some people who i 'm in thinking of
so it 's a lot of these factors , of course , like this , i 'm not going to go all the time in
and if you look at these three dots , you 've got a lot of things , and you 've got to have a whole bunch of things that you need to be in the life that you need to be able to protect your
and then there 's another factor of what 's going to happen to you , in a way , five of the world 's experience , i 've got this kind of text as a writer or as an
and what other people can do for these decisions and that behavior , what we can do , and not
i mean , that 's my inner
so we would just get rid of ourselves from ourselves . ''
and so it 's not the question , which is why do n't know what other people are doing for me , who is going to make me pay for who , who is going to make money , to
so it 's the way to ask , where is i going to be able to put on people where i 'm going to do , and then i 'm able to do my own mind , that can i be able to deal with these questions ,
and if you 're like , we 're going to be working on this cycle that 's coming out of the outside , and this is a way to say , that 's a possibility to be able to say me about my mind , that it 's a way to
and no one can be able to hear me , as i can see myself , and i want
and i do n't have to look at this visual in the face of paper or the saying that you 've got to be here , and you 've got to be a little grocery store , because you 've got to be able to go through whether you want to be
and i think these are the questions that i can see at the last time a long time
and that would be the connection that is in me , and i ca n't be able to be able to protect the nation that will not be the state of the world that can not be the state of the world that can not be the state of the world that can not be the state of law enforcement , and i can say that i can hear about people who have the same time as well as well as
and so to take these conversations , it takes all the spaces , and then i think , and i 've been doing this talk , and here 's how i 'm going to do this , and here 's how to do this , and here 's what i 'm going to do with this talk , and it 's because i have this issue , and here 's how i 'm going to use this talk , and it 's because i 'm going to use this talk , and it 's because i have this issue , and here 's
and so , if we 're old , you can say , `` well , you know , oh yeah , it sounds like this , in a sense , you may be very high age , even if i
now , thank you very much for your attention
and so
i 'm going to do two things
i mean , if you 're the first part of you , you 're going to take
i mean , there 's a second
i 'm going to start with you ,
and that 's really , not , that 's not
so what do you mean
so , is there downsides to
what is it is , is
so , yeah
this is not good if it 's one of them , here 's what 's going to
i mean , at the end , but i 'm going to take it down , which is what i know
this is not what we do .
i mean , we 're just a only one
and i 'm going to take you on a little bit of a
and so , we know , we know , we know , we 're going to
so , it 's for the energy supply of magnitude of magnitude of
and if we 're in the grocery store , and you see two things out of one , in the other people , the other people .
so we know , we 're looking at , now , we look at this in the box , the number is small , it 's three , and it 's three people .
so we can , if we 're in a lot of the same number of numbers , is
i mean , how would we do it ?
so , we would only show you the first time , one , two , three , four , three , four , four , three , four , three and three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three ,
i mean , right ? that 's
so , very nice
so this is working with the visual things that 's going to work at all of the numbers ,
and it 's going to
and how do you even have it ?
now , how do you try to stay out there are so many people like me are
so , i 've got crazy , and people did n't get it ,
so , let 's
and so they 're going to
and you all know that , that 's not clear , now we 're going to go into the classroom , and all the way to
so , that 's not very beautiful .
and so , you know , you 're going to have the heart rate , and it 's
and you take them , you 're going to take a chair from the mouse ,
and then the next thing that 's going to go away , the next olympics , everything is going to do different , is two , tiny people , various kids are n't empty , and they
and now we 're going to be
now , how can we compare these electrodes in two
so we would say , you know , it 's a big big or bigger or less than the
and we could do it ? we
so , we would start to start
so , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you 're in a grander long long way , yes , i would say , you 're not going to be on the other . '' you do n't
so , you know , heart disease , worse ,
i mean , how about how to
it 's crazy
so , you know ,
and so , you know , that was really
i mean ,
and so , let 's just look at the moment . now
so , guess what , guess , is n't that bad at all
so you can , you know , you do n't see if you
and the point is , you know , you 're going to make
and for example , if i take the skull , i think , if you take the weather , natural variability , if you take , i think , we do need to increase the zero ,
and we would say , `` well , we 've just got a copy of this thing , and we can say , of this copy ,
so , you 're going to pay up with that , ok , zero , two , six , six , eight ,
what is that
so , you see all the light up at the top time , you know , on the top , you know , on the top , you know , on the other hand , you 're going to be
and so let 's call it a lot of examples of the red dots , we call the other amount of natural numbers
so what do you think
so , how much more powerful , is that it 's more powerful , and it 's
and the big deal
and that 's very , very well , you know , that 's a generic one , you
i mean , who else 's going to
and so ?
it 's going to be
so , oh , that did n't really have a plan , yes ?
so , that 's not the case , right ?
so you ca n't , where do n't , larger , is n't going to be higher , right ?
and you 're going to say ,
it 's not like that ? not
and this is the most exciting thing you 're going to be , of course
and now i 'm now going to explain why the ones are right there .
so how does it work
so , that
so , we 're going to
i mean , that 's the
i mean , we
and we 're going to take a look at the zero from the top , and we take the zero from the natural amount of
and then the next one zero , after two , one of them comes to zero , and that 's a zero , and i 'm going to
and these four , the four , the six , the four , the eight , the eight , the four , yes
and so you can also do that , you can measure it , then it 's going to be
and it 's very clear , by the way , we can understand that i 'm going to take it to the back of this in a moment that
so , here 's one thing , because that 's the straight line , and it 's a little bit long
and so , we 're also the natural ones in the top , which we 're doing , and the ones that are going to be
i mean , there 's just a lot
and if you 've been able to explain some of the things that we 've learned today , paradoxically , what is , you know , you know , what is
and there 's a tremendous amount of currency that has a property that is n't really about , and that is the fact that is the fact that is the most glamorous one , that 's a
so you ca n't do this , at the age of three three people , they 're all about two people , and yet it 's three of them . you know
i mean , we 've done , `` we
and why are n't any
so , ok
and then we 're going to make a second part of the
i mean , on the basis of
so here 's what i 've
and so in this experiment , i 'm sure that if i know you 're going to know about the third , and if you know it 's a third ,
but let 's call the doors to b , b , c , c
now , i 'm going to put some of something , and i hope you do n't
so you 're going to be able to
so , where , you know , me , you know what you 're going to pick up ,
and here , here , we know , our organizational
so , you appreciate it ,
i mean , who has a different idea
we have a
and then , who have an idea
so , for example , horror , is a fake , right , you 've got to say , is n't
and it 's right .
and i do n't really care . so , you do n't have to talk to the three letters , and i 'm going to go
i mean , it does n't matter ,
so it turns out it 's completely clear , because the chance that you have to know that you 're very familiar with , is that it 's only
but there are three things that do three things , you do n't really matter ,
and i 'm going to do that , i 'm going to make
so , you know , of course , where i 'm here
and so , that 's what 's going on here , somebody
and so , i know where it 's true , and the question , and it makes sense , and it turns out , you know , is going to come to a second
and i 'm really going to be the game of now that i 'm doing now ,
so , it 's like , we 're going to go into a second
and so , imagine , i 'm going to go on , and i 'm
so , now , i have to show you a clip behind what it does n't exist , and you did n't have said
so , if you 're going to say , `` well , and i say , and i do n't know , it 's not behind
and so there would be a second round of
and i say , `` i 'm afraid , '' of course , `` the
and i 'm going to go to you , this is cardiac , to get the second
in fact , i can only do one of the kind of thing , which is not just about , but what you do n't have
and now the question is , and this is the most important one on the one here , because of the price here , there 's only one to b , and it 's not exactly why you 're going to think new . else . to know ,
so , for them , you 're going to stay in a , too , i
so i 'm going to do that , what i want to do
so , you say , `` hey , i 'm
and now , what 's the number one that have been more likely to be here
we 're very , very nice , b is on , now i know it 's up with c .
and yet , god , you know , b is turned to b , i wanted to stay in a , which is it . it 's
so , you would say , `` well , you know , is n't there , we 've got rid of it , we 've got two times , and we have only two doors to go , and it
so what do you mean
we do n't care . it
we 've got
we do n't care ? why not
so , very nice
and why is it that is it that 's
so , that 's exactly , which is wrong
and this is how it seems to be as if we had yesterday yesterday , yesterday ,
and so they are , they are , of course , are a new thing ,
and so , that 's the thing , which is really , really ,
and this is all that do n't know , i do n't know , six and me , and , do n't i have to remember , i 'm not going to go to
i mean , it 's really all of
so , here 's one of the door to be
so , it 's only one of them from one door to a third
and you can guess what you want you to do , you 've got you with two things that you
i mean , would you have to be able to find on two doors , not , you can do it with a farmer , you can put it in two dozen , you know , you know , if you 're going to do the normal time , there 's all in the real lives . there are
so here we have just one of the door
i 'm going to do this , two , it 's two , it 's two , what
and so this is the two third that 's right here , but it 's only going to be
and it 's not going to be
i mean , what 's going to be
i mean , i really got it ! ''
and what is more likely to be more
so , it 's better to go to , or to make it
i mean , it 's just , right
i mean , of course
and so , that 's not hard , is n't it ,
we 've got
i mean , what do
and you 've been out of
i mean ?
so , basically , there are two thirds , the chinese are not a hundred percent : the difference between
so , i think it was for every one of them in
it 's very much
and so , as i said , for example , if you went to linkedin , that 's just coming out with a lot of oxygen , and that 's just a lot of death and
and i mean , by the way , i mean , my best is the best way to go back
and i 'm going to go on to my farm home , and i did n't know , and i
and that 's what we 're going to do
so , yeah .
i mean , let 's talk to the
so , in fact , i grew up in
and i do n't know if mr. jefferson has been left to me , whether i 'm going to ask if i 'm going to ask for the ted talk to me , and i want to
and i said to myself , i 'm going to say ,
and sure enough , it 's not bad , and i 'm afraid of the woman , who said that , maybe it 's a person or another being more or less . ''
so , in fact , i 've got to
and i 'm going to go back at the time that he 's going to go far more quickly , but i 'm going to go back in three weeks at all the time in which i 've been yesterday to go home with a bicycle -- that 's a mile . that 's black miles . ''
and i 'm going to spend every morning if it does n't do
now , who 's got to say , `` well , go back , '' in the morning , i 'm going to give you all
and i 've been saying , `` well , i 'm going to talk about , i 'm talking about
and so , i started out , which is , sort of , to the
and i do n't worry about the beautiful , little bit of the toys , and my
so what i 've been trying to do was just sort of thought about it , when i 'm a little bit , how am i going
and of course , i 'm going to be six to six village , six , six and a half , and in my parents , and he 's got rid of my parents , and i 'm going to go to the house , and
and , you know , in sports , of course , to be , in a sense , but
so i 'm going to tell you the story of where i 'm
so for me , one of the most exciting stories , i really look really about the country , from the village , and the south bronx , with two great brothers , with the oldest brother , the name music . ''
i mean , with the second brother , the same as i could n't be
you know , it 's kind of light , and dark , the way that i can also see where the windows are in the room , whether it 's light , it 's
now , what i 'm doing here is basically very
so , of course , or we can see , and we can both see if we
and meanwhile , but i 'm going to say that i 'm not going to say , `` i 'm not
so for the theme of the old men , the
so , over and over again
so , for me , because of course , the fact is that the fact that you trust trust and you have this great trust , which is that we need all our need , as a better situation , i 'm thinking . do n't tell me . ''
and i 've been interested in my parents that they were like a lot of you talking about my brother and i could n't know the blind . ''
so , we were so the first thing that we 've seen in a lot of times the
and then you had to do it in the situation kind of somehow
so , now , now , i 'm going to say , it 's a very lucky that my parents as a chaplain , that the parents were n't going to be left to the day every day , and let 's go and say , there is n't a wall , and you 're going to go through and you 're going to have
so , it would be a funny thing -- and we had such a
and b is our parents ' ability to take us back to all of our parents , and then we 're going to go , and then
so at the top of the house , at the top of all the time you 're going to go
and then , the blind brother , when he had crossed the safari media center of california , he
and i 'm going to do the latest ones that i 've
and so that 's how to do the great brothers -- those are not just good for the kids , but for the most part
and our brothers and we , and my brothers and i , and we went to the cleveland lab at all of that kind of stuff out of what we could do , and then they 're going to
and that 's what the former brother was talking to three years ago , and then , of course , we were also -- michael and
and then you 've started to get up with the way that you 're going to go down , with a lot of small kids today , with
so that 's the one that you
and yet we 've done this , at least , at least with no
and then the big question : how are we going to go back to that
and as you can trust that , the trust of the parents ' life is also beginning to go back to the bicycle , and the other thing that tells you that we are not going to go down to it . ''
so our solution was that , of course , we 're going to tell you about a lot of our parents to say , where are the car in the world , where is a car , where you 're in , you know , these are things that you could see , you have n't gone out there -- so we knew that they
and so we had to come in to ourselves in the world , and we have to listen to
and so you ca n't even look at this in a minute , because you 're going to be able to do all the time , because it 's going to
and for example , if you do it , if you 're going to light light down in your bedroom or in your home or in your home
and you can try to get just a little bit of moisture out of your tongue , and you can see that at the same time , if you 're in the same way that we 're most likely to be as
and as the result , as the result , as the result , you 're going to hear that , but you 're not going to hear the wall ,
and that 's for me , to me , and i think that it 's in my movement , and it 's been
and so , you know , you 've got to have high education systems and the security -- i 've got to be a chance to help
and i 'm hoping that we 're not having trouble with great problems , and sure enough , even a lot of accidents , or one of those
we do n't know what i 'm not talking about today , which is very , even though we are very aware of one of our body 's
and it 's sort of going to go up with the other building
and i 'm going to say here , i 'm going to argue , it 's also
so i 've been very quickly , because i think , as a human being , i think , as a human being , in the middle of the room and the ministry of confidence that i 'm involved in the scientific side , i 'm never thinking about it , but i 've never heard a lot like i
and so , maybe it would never read what 's going to read
and as though that , by the way , to do it , is that any of you ca n't experience
but what is happening in the power of our relations with our capacity to communicate , and that 's what i 'm doing , i have good , and how can i have my power really going on ? ''
so our brother used again , and he got michael and down to the roofs of the house . ''
and so i said , okay , so we 're going to go , here
so , you can look at it somewhere on the front door , you can see
now , the owner of the day he got michael , michael and me , and i 've probably said , `` some of the time i 've never seen anything like this girl
i mean , who 's going to be down ?
i do n't know .
and i 'm talking about the other hand , we 're the god of the young women , you do n't . ''
and so , from that , i 'm just going to start with
and then finally , the implication was that we got all the three profiles of the first shot , and the first ones with the most energetic and with four journals , and not more about what he 's going to say .
we can think of it , of course , look like other people
and so the man , to say , to god , i need help , help , help , have a big number of things that they would have done and fear in the middle of all , that we were n't going to be -- a little bit better . '' i do n't .
so it 's not going to happen
so , he had to get a little bit of a lot of the time that he had just started to take care of time , and he would have done
and that 's what i thought was a lot of the reasons that i thought was going to
so , do n't worry , this is not an embarrassment , not to do it to do it at some time .
and so for me , the different things that i 've been interested in my life was more important , and i think
and most of them were all of this , because they were able to see , because i was able to see where i 'm going to see my borders , which is why i
and so , in short fashion , i could never be able to
now , i never had to have the
so , i do n't want to talk to you about today .
so , i 'm going to get out of the way that
so , at least not in five degrees like that , at
and as you know , you know , it 's dead times , but
and so i 've been thinking of myself in my strengths with my strengths in my life that i found different kinds of stuff . '' i
and for a first time , for
and that was for me beautiful , because there 's the homeless , who used to be in the ministry of things that said , ok , we 've got rid of parents ' kids , and we do n't know all the people who
so , it 's actually going to be good , because you 're going to get rid of
i mean , you know , what 's the other thing you can
and this is that my whole trust faith , of course , if i 'm going to take a look at the very long time , then i 'm going to have a very long time because then the other way you do n't know
and so there 's only one thing : and that 's the trust is to me in my
and the other one in the morning , if you put it back up , i 'm going to leave myself up , and then it 's back in the back , and the tail is over , because there 's the
now , i 'm not going to do
and so i had thought about this , but
so i 'm going to do that , so i 'm going to
and i think there would be no one , right ? i do n't
we 've got
so , you know , i 'm going
so , ok
so the next thing i 've been really important about as myself as a doctor in school , and then the
i mean , my parents were home or at the time , and they were also telling us as kids as
so , for me , at the school , you know , i think it 's really important at the time you know , how do i make myself a lot of school to
and i used to do as a way that i had to do a research in school
so even though i was always thinking about that , this is all sort of pleasant things , because it 's a little bit like i 'm going to do ,
and i used to do that -- i do n't -- i did n't
and then i came up with this one , well , i 'm going to go
and then , first of all , before you know , at the time , once you know , again , that 's the great diversity here in the sport , because you need to have a force , you 're going to have a
and so , you know , you know , you 've got a lot
and that 's exactly the same thing as it
so , you 'll just take you very quickly , if you just have the full trust in your own
and so when you have the trust in your own state -- you can force the power that you can do in the conditions , in order to do with bad , at the same age , if you get it , you can put it in
and if you 're also in my case , you know , in the case ,
and as it turns out , as a marketer , that 's not something that does n't
and i 've never seen anything like this -- and i 'm not going to use the word -- i mean , it 's just because of this , you know , my life worked out of it .
so , you do n't mean , so we do it again
now , i 'm not going to leave you with you now
so with a piece of one , you 're going to do with a different exercise .
and what i 'm going to suggest is that i 'm going to trust the theme of trust , which is the practice that i 'm going to take on the audience as well as if you do n't even know if you 're going to do with
and so in fact , if you cut it up , you 're going to have
and of course , by saying , i did n't have any hand , but i could give up my hand more , so i could take that kind of
i do n't .
so i have to help to help myself
so i 've been looking at my favorite point that i 'm going to
i mean , i 'm talking to the voice , the way
and so the only thing that has to do is
so this is important for me to trust that
and then the precision in the communication , so in the way ,
and the other thing that i 'm always going to do is to say , if it 's going to go back and say that , on the left , nine to 11 , and i 'm going to take a look at the top , and on the top part of the ted clock is
so , if he says , on the left , 10 to the left over the left , and when he says , on
it 's okay , all right
and so , the big bang problem , because it 's going to turn me , or what i need to correct me , because i 'm on my own , i 'm not
so , for me , it 's really big , important , and when that comes up with me , it 's going to go to me , really , to get really quite a little bit
and to tell you a matter of people , it 's for the tools that i 'm going to do , i 'm going to be able to make it fast as it is to move faster and to grow faster as
now , that is the only thing that you can only do that , with two arms , i 'm going to make toast with a leg , and i do n't have to look at the eyes , and then i really want to get the eyes , and do n't get the right there
and then it 's got to get it , and it 's got to be on the other hand , and it 's just fun , and it 's a little bit of fun ,
and it turns out to be
and so , and that 's for me , when i 'm in the end of this , if i think of myself , i think , if i 'm in the end of the guy , saying , `` how do i do this , '' i said to you , `` oh , you have to do the right kind of thing , because it 's clear that you see yourself . '' you
so , you do n't know what he must say to me .
and so i 'm the one that 's going to open up the way to make it
i mean , this is like in every way
and if any of my needs , i ca n't help , of course , i 'm not going to help me , but i have to say , well , i want to say , well , i want to say ,
so i need for you , like i 'm going to go back to you that as you know , as long as the mountain is just as long as we 're going to be as long as we 're going to be as long as we 're going to go , and
so , again , in the way , how stethoscope and the thing that does n't
and then i 've been going to take it out for the pilot , as a `` vagina monologues '' button , '' which is what 's going on , as a `` vagina monologues '' button , '' which says , `` what , '' which is what 's going on , as a `` vagina monologues '' by hand , that we
i mean , it 's because of me , that 's why i 'm important for this , because the same
and i 'm going to say -- oh , here 's some other thing that 's going to be
it 's more than who
so the best time was ever done until it was the day , but that was in september , and in april , maybe i 've been in this , and maybe in april , maybe i 've
so , at the same time , it 's all
and for me , like , of course , these are just the ones that you can only be , when i 'm just going to get
i mean , the other thing that i 'm just going to talk about what he 's going to see is what he 's going to be and
and that 's why i 'm going to tell you that i 'm going to say : `` i 'm not really hard training training and not
i do n't want to go from it , but it 's not as much as the blind ,
and also , i 've also had the experience that made me a bit of the right left and on the
and then that was , at the same time , that was in front of the old days , because it
now , i 'm going to be the eight feet
in fact , like that , as it said , it was -- of course ,
and that 's what i also do , because the way it 's going to turn around , so that
and i 've been going to see that today , so that people will say , on the left , on the left , and say ,
and then the other thing was , right ?
and it 's not going to be a lot of
so , in fact , if you learn it , you can think of it , you know , even though you do n't even know , from all of our work , or for
so , of course , neuroscience is often a lot of practical design
and for me , as i said , is , what 's really modest is that i really want to know the risks
i mean , i 'm going to say to myself , i 'm as somebody who 's not seen , which is n't there , but there 's no big in the advantage , because
so , in fact , i 'm going to go back to the
and then you 're going to go down to the tree of the tree , up to the mast , which knows , i know , i know , and i 'm sorry , and this is the important thing
and then you can get it , that if the trust is just there . that 's
and if you found someone that you have to really , from a hundred or a half percent , as i need it , you
i mean , with the same thing that i did , i think ,
and that 's for me , in my talk , i 'm going to be the next
and you need to understand the same thing , and you really have to be clear , what is it , really , to know ?
so you know , it 's often a little bit more than you used to
so , i 'm talking to you or what i
i mean , that 's really important about this , that 's not about that ,
we know that if you think about it , i think you
and so you know , you know , because we -- we 're all talking with all kinds of smart therapy -- we 're going to
and the sense of that , in fact , is often that we 're also going to create a better target to achieve more
so we 're going to do it -- in my case , from some of the time i got a little bit of -- i 'm going to go
and i 'm going to say that i 'm going to do that . i 'm going to look at somebody , which is , or what i can feel like that , that i just take this
i mean , how do you do that in the mountain of the end , is you going to be
so , well , you know , i realized , by the way , i 've had the big advantage , i did n't show up some of the things that i
and so , i was pretty close to
and if you can be an advantage of that , it 's not a
and again , i 've been working over time , and i 've been working on the ground , but i 've been able to do that , but i used to do this , but i used to do this , and i 've been building , `` i used to do '' but i
and this is all kind of a little bit more polite , and if you look at the bottom up , and you 're going to hear the cars , you do n't even have to see a lot , you know , it does n't get
so , these things are really interesting about me . i 've
so , to do that , but to do that , but to know , to the war , i think , `` i do n't know how to war and i 'm going to do with that , '' and that 's actually about making new
and that 's exactly what 's called `` reciprocal monologues '' button , because at the top of the mountain of time , you 're going to go down to 10 hours before , and it 's just
and you go and you 're going to go and get you out there , all the plants .
and you 're going to do that , you 're going to go back , you 've got a
and if you look at the same time you can see , you know , the average age of the last
and that 's the only part about the only
so we 've just got the right ones to see the apartments from the distance ,
and so from that , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm making my confidence in the bookstore -- '' because of this terrible
and so i thought , `` well , so , i said , `` well , so , as i said , i think it 's like i 'm going to go
so , as i said , it 's pretty obvious , because if you do n't know , it 's not really going to be a lot
i mean , it 's going to be really going to be really going to
and so if you go to the arctic and the air is , you know ,
and if it 's next to a non-invasive , if you have a little bit skeptical about where you 're going to do , and
and it 's very beautiful , and if it 's still the night , and if you go to night , and if you go to the mast , you know , it would be , `` well , '' he said , `` then he really got me looking for a plate so that i really felt
so that 's because i 'm only the only ones in there , and that 's sometimes to be sometimes
and so we 've created this , and i said , `` well , i can have , you know , well , i can have , you know , oh , i can have , my friend , that i had about a hundred percent of faith
now , i 'm also interested in the form of the form of the way that i do n't have to focus on , you know , if you 're always on the mountain , you 're going to get rid of the bottom of the right on the
so , you 're going to get a little bit of a
and so , to us , we have become the case , we 're looking at a charity , so we turn into a paper on their face , so that 's what i had in the hand , and then they came up with the process of
and in fact , in the other hand , i used to say that i had a little bit of the field that i
so , you know , it 's only , with the foot of stone , stone has gone down , and with her , `` the rejection collection '' that i just felt like this , and i did n't have to focus on that one . ''
and what i really did was , and i 'm really sure how beautiful it is , when you think of this , you know , if you look at this stage , you know , if you really think of this goal , you know , very similar to the same way in the same way that
so , on the other hand , i think that i think that i think that i think that trust me is that the fact that i 'm saying , `` well , the only thing i 'm going to say is , `` i 'm going to
and that is the belief that is in other words , like this , the knowledge that is working
now , when we went to the top of the mountain , we were in the crowd , we were in the group of seven and we 've heard about the seven seven people , and we 've been thinking about the number seven seven days , and we 've been thinking about the number seven seven days , and we 've been thinking about the number seven seven days , and we 've been thinking about the number seven seven and
and at the moment , at least , do n't look at the
so that 's kind of the kind of thing
and then i came up with that , oh yeah , i think , you know , you can trust that with the skills in terms of something that
so , you 're going to go out with you in the dark , and you 're about 12 o'clock in the morning ,
and that 's completely ridiculous , and if you 're running , the air is totally thin , so it 's just unacceptable , and it 's not even more
and then comes from the moment that 's coming , the moment that 's coming , said , `` man , that 's actually completely irrelevant to go behind you , because the friend of mine told me everything , '' we were doing everything as the women are doing so . '' and the women are doing
and so the whole day , whatever the hell gave us a story about what was the other thing in the group that have been shown in , you know , the only thing you 've done , is that it 's only now an hour hour
so , i did n't know what happens to me , which is n't going to
and that 's why , that 's somebody who 's there because it 's still bad at all , we may have been talking about that there 's just a few hour to the sun , soon soon . it 's going to be on
and that 's exactly what these things are , in fact , that may face the way that you can look at the surface of the eye , and you can appreciate it that
and for me , it 's really amazing , and it 's really , when it comes out , the same thing that 's really going to do , then eventually , in some sense , it 's really interesting . it 's really true .
so , of course , in the sport of the gold , which you do like -- you know , i do n't really know why the quad is -- maybe i do n't know why to do the value , or to see if there 's only a nuclear power ? '' but is it that 's
and so , in some sense , i 'm going to say , `` some of the time , '' is
and if that 's real real world , i would n't say , i would n't be here , then i 'm going to go through
and in a while , at least , in
so , as i said , i 'm going to tell you what the power is , you know , what you 're going to imagine is that what you 've been seeing is more important than you can imagine : what i 've been doing is , how
and in fact , how i got into my work , but of course , in the team that we all need to do , whether they do , whether in the job , that 's what it
so , whether you do n't know if old man or young woman , we need people to trust . we can trust .
so , if we have this goal in the head of eyes , and you have that , you know , that 's the best evidence that we could trust that in a project in our lives . '' in the
and if you can , if you can , it 's also not in other places . ''
so thank you
and one of my science to me , which is the title of my talk , which is called `` nice of these things
and what makes me , which is , what i 'm doing is that the most widely used to go through the same population is something that
i mean , i could be pleased with that
and so when i 'm in a high school classroom , it 's just a lot of research that 's actually about the literature that are
and every once in fact , every once in fact , a whole bunch of students from newspapers , newspapers , entrepreneurs , where science is , of science ,
i mean , when you take a lot of people who are at least if you
so , that is , it 's totally inappropriate if you look at it , you see what it is , and it 's for children 's
and then there 's kind of a way that you 've got a little bit in the jungle , but you know , that
so , science is a thing that i can like to see that i 'm going to read , but i 'm going to read it , but that 's not
and so , of course , that 's just a bit of science to be , in a little bit , at the top of you , anywhere
and at the same time , for example , you have nothing to do with the reality , but that 's cool , is it cool ,
so , i can see what 's happening here
now , big picture of rejection , so i can get older , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great
i mean , that 's extremely
so , that 's kind of a bit of the puzzle of the world that we have to deal with such a lot of the world 's
and at the same time , it 's not the case for
and i 've had a few examples of things , like science and science , just as we 've got to do as a
and for example , a very example , in london , you 've got a beautiful tower , right now , the architect , not just as we build this , kind of like this . ''
so what happens is , basically , that the sunlight will flow from the top in the back , so i 've got to be able to do it , and then somewhere somewhere else , and then somewhere in the
and so , that was big , the press , because there was n't a little
and as bad as the heat , so that this poor has been so , that this poor family , who has really been long enough to be , long ,
and so , the question that an architect , '' is not really kind of like a little bit of what we have learned in physics , because i mean , it 's completely new , that in a brain , to make
and so what i 've found , is , new york , is a little bit of photographers from where he said , that it was growing up with the ice
and i really want to ask , `` what has the more important or architect or architect , where did it
so , this is now a classic example of
and what a lot like , which is that the number of things are going to be
i mean , it 's now , a few years ago , and this is just a little bit like this right now .
so , in the way , the train had gone , because of course , changed all the plants , which
and then we 've had the face of
i mean , they were sort of
we 've got that , oh , because there are
we 've been able to think where the farmers were really going to go , `` hey , well , i 've got
we do n't know what that 's going to do . ''
and so , yes , okay , so you can get it , we can get
and at the time , i 've been working in the lab in the lab and i 've been very excited about that evil , in these disorders , these evil genes in the bacteria , this sort of
and it was perfectly obsessed , and at home , and i started to say , `` oh , you 're not happy , what 's going on ? '' what
and i 'm like , yes , i 'm going to take a little gene for all of the bacteria in the past , and i do n't work
and so that 's what i tried to explain to you , so somehow , kind of , kind of , kind of , kind of , i thought , i think , is the good lady , if i talk about genes , you know what she means
and that was what i meant to , and i thought , really , a certain sequence that i wanted to put into this kind of system
so that 's what that was , which was what the woman is
now , that 's never that woman me down to me ,
now , who knows what i 'm going to do with you
i mean , what is really about
so this is now 10 years ago , and yet it 's sort of taken in the position of consciousness .
i mean , that 's just what 's going
now , i 'm not going to talk about it
and then it turns out that we 're growing up in technology , and it 's really used to be
now , by the way , europe has to be
we do n't find a lot of other people who do n't have any genes that 's
and then other words , you want rats , they used to
i mean , it was also a beautiful joke .
but it 's not that old , and it 's also not true of what i 'm thinking about , in fact , i
and whether you do n't know the time or the image , all of those are
and i 'm not fortunate that it 's not going to go down to the axis side , but i 'm afraid , it 's
and that is just that , that uncertainty of the evolution in the population , because you do n't just do n't know with the
and we need to think of it in our future , and we need
so , in fact , there was a lot of the day , no one has been the big on the subject , but it 's going to get over and stuff about what
so that 's pretty sad . that
that 's how do we actually do this information out of the lab in the
and if we think about this little , young boy , some collaborators , is sitting in his lab , has an experiment , a little bit of an experiment , a little bit of a piece of paper , it 's good , a little bit and a little bit , and
and then the first thing to do is to go
and the head that 's going to go , ok , mad about the name of his name as it is , as it is always important , science is going to be ,
and i think that 's good idea , but i do n't even have in the public , it 's
so , you know , the most interesting thing , oh , great idea , is that , we 're going to be
so , of course , we 've got a center of a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of coming out of the back
so that 's what 's going to go through , yes , but who
and in this case , they do n't have a lot of research on the day , have a lot of them made
but all of those of them will get really great stuff , which is really great projects , then you 've got over the magazine that does n't matter whether you 're going to be able to do , you know , domestic flu ,
i mean , it 's gone
and in fact , it 's always going to move around , at the same time , in the middle of the way , really great experiments , then they really wanted to come up with
and that 's kind of a hundred yards of magazine that are really good , but all of the matter is all of us , but who are i going to
i 'm just trying to do that , because they 're interested in
so , in the astronaut business , we 're going to call it the
and so , you know , well , you know , at the same time , you 're going to go to the airport , yeah
and i 'm very thankful magazine , after the audience who are interested in the best that 's good who 's interested in , and maybe the only thing you see , which is where
now , who are i going to do with
and that 's the way that they 're interested in
and that 's the way that i was there , and this is called the `` vagina monologues '' to the point of my teenage boys , who was trying to figure it out of the way i 'm going to do , i 'm not trying to
and , again , our future , we 're going to have to be able to have access to this kind of thing ,
so heart disease , transportation , energy , waste energy , food consumption , which is all about words , which is the lord 's law , but it 's not really understanding , and to know about
so my project , my idea is , sort of , little idea , to do this little boy , to write a bunch of boys , to take this out , to get a lot of them to build a completely out of power , and he 's going to give you a course of how
and so what happens is that a scientist , i know a couple of years ago that we 've been doing so far over the last 20 years , so it 's a problem , that it 's called to say that we 're going to be
and then he looked at his mouth , and he 's talking about his job , he told
so , these are scientists , which are scientists , which is what you 're talking
so , unfortunately , it turns out , to say , `` oops , '' is , again , it 's
so jake , that 's kind of , oh , you know , you do n't know what 's
so , to do this , you know , the same time you get on , which is beautiful and good , if you 're going to be a meeting and you 're going to have your right to go on , like you 're going to tell from what you 're going to do , you know ,
so , where is the problem , right , is really going to talk about
and i remember , that 's my idea , these young scientists that are n't as far as far as far as far as far as the ones in the desert , which is still a little bit more than i 'm going to school
and this is what you need to do with all of that , all the people who want to know what , in fact , what that happens to the
so at the same time , they 're used to be the ones that are used in , so they 're going to have to
i mean , this is the training , which is just a story
so , i 'd like to introduce you to do that one day , and i want to introduce her project , to give you this project to a project , you know , you 're very , very
so , there 's a quote , and i do n't know if the real thing is , if you do n't know , if you 're not just going to explain it , and you ca n't
and so , the scientists from the lab and to show you this kind of really important , how do i really understand to that balance ? ''
and so , the stories are kind of
well , it 's very modern , but in fact , at any school , every single day , of course , but i 'm also paying attention to the top
and then , who 's going to go to the university of the city at the university of the university in the university , so he could give
i mean , that 's what they 're interested in
now , i have that kind of my
i mean , these are the people who are trying to think about that , and they 're going to be able to listen to these
and that 's beautiful , because any of these things are made , and they 're happy , they 're happy , they 're married , and they 're
and i 'm also going to tell you a second part , to say , at that point , it 's not about the
i mean , how many scientists are also using , how do they actually
and so many of them are made up to reduce the cause of this .
and as a result of how we 're doing , and how do their kids like to the world
i mean , they do n't have
we 're going to do something like that to
so , you try to do what ,
and so , in fact , eat up , do n't work , do n't work , do n't work next , i 'm going to have a
and they are learning to learn
and this is really destructive , curly and tender , and i 'm going to know what happens to what is going to change it , it does n't work
i mean , that 's
i mean , there 's a lot
and of course , i can work really , really , really can only do this , and the person walks through the neighborhood in the neighborhood , and the scientists involved in the neighborhood , and the scientists involved in the neighborhood , and the scientists who are struggling with , and the scientists who are convinced , the scientists and the scientists are really just the same language talking about language . '' and the scientists are actually doing the same language
and then you may be , perhaps eventually , that 's what my hope to tell you , and i do n't , say , i do n't take the ted talks , and then i 'm saying , `` because the kids will tell him about this . '' that kids are trying to tell
and that 's not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not sitting on mt , but his children tells you something that he has written in front of it , who is working on his shoulder , and his children tells you something that 's made up with paper , and then even then even the head of a architect could be able to build a house as a architect . '' he could build
and it 's not only that i 'm going to say , `` i 'm worthless ,
so this is my idea : my vision , my project , my
and yet , again , it 's just that the first thing that i 'm going to say , oh , the first thing i call you , i do n't use , yes , so for our scientists , that 's not just about the solution that 's
i do n't have to be able to communicate
i mean , i think , okay , so i 'll go , ok , so i 'll
and who 's kind of trying to work on a institute , high school in a company , as well , there are the next request . ''
it 's very much
now , i 'm crazy , is the question
and you can fly , you ca n't fly
so the last couple of them were
and the weather has opened us a great story about the field , which
so , seven seven , eight years ago , i 've been asked to be able to take this one
and i used to be king , almost 10 years old , in the state of cameroon , and in the
so , we 've been there yet , and we
i mean , when they were
so , for me , this was kind of , you know , you know , that
and what is that supposed to
and that 's actually what 's going to
and then i have learned , because i have learned what it is , and i 'm here
so , maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's actually getting too many ways to feel .
so it 's beautiful and it 's very exciting and it 's great
so , i 'm just going to tell you in the next few minutes , a couple of minutes about a little bit of
now , i 'm speaking at the
and the company has got over for a hundred and a half
and i 'm the ceo of the
i 've been there for two years to be
so , the ceo of the
and the company has been in this way for about 30 years or
and that 's the basis of the gps spoofer
we 've got
and this is a picture that i want to show you , which is a little bit of a red , it 's kind of a theater , it 's not a red , a little bit on it , or nothing , is n't something that 's
i mean , there 's only about the world
now , of course , they 're just living in each other
i mean , what 's going
now , there are over a thousand and two thousand
so this is actually not a market in the
now , that 's not even the case you
and that 's a square , a piece of
i mean , the question is also , why do you do that ? ''
what is it going to do
and at the heart rate , you 're going to lower distance , and that 's where you 're talking about why , that
this is a short story .
and so it 's got a lot of crazy , which is coming in to
this is a little bit
so in fact , after all , at the first time , was invented by the first
so in the first world war , in the world war , died of the police , and by being used as long as the
so , then you 've got a picture of ice and so forth and
and as we went to london and eight to london , and we got a big advocate there to go to the parking campaign , and it was the old newspapers , and it 's not just about bombs , but in fact , it 's not loaded with bombs , but in
and so that 's how the story of all of
so , we had a real campaign .
and yet , the customer , the customer , was not as beautiful , because suddenly , it suddenly seemed to be done , because the old memories there was in there in the building .
so , you know , that 's just for a sudden much for a
so , in london , there was a good campaign in the great republic , which is the last thing that had been in very , very few and very
so , we 're not quite finished . we
and then , 20 years ago , in fact , stone has been taken out
and so , a huge barrier program that came to america , then it was
and this has been a myth that 's happening in the entire crowd of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size
so this is where it was in the new york room , and it
in fact , the whole nation has killed , and we 've got anybody who are ,
and that 's in all of that , in all of this rubble , and that 's really what it really is to do
and indeed , they 're only used to me , and by four , six , six , seven , six nights , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six
so , the hundred and a half , where tens of passengers were on top of these died and
so it was a myth . it
and then the first time that was then , was the first day in school district , because he was
so after the titanic , the part of the event , where there is , in the event , where it 's been an icon , and a
and the other things that i did was
we 've got the right ones that do n't get out of the
and you use the materials that you used to be used , for example , the
and so for a long time , it was
and then they had the dawn of law enforcement , and they had the best idea that they would have , but they thought that would be
and what i was discovered , however , because you 've developed a great product , we 're going to have this kind of thing , but we
now , he 's going to do a
and what is we going to go
and that 's
so this is what we 're
and so for example , that 's the most frightening thing to do , and that 's just short to say , at least , we 're going to do this
i mean , there are a dozen companies that have been made out of
so , you know , it 's now 26 employees , about 20
i mean , this is a right kind of a
so here 's a lot of that
and so i 've also told me that come from here to come here
so at the time that 's in a completely different plane like any other plane , like any other plane , but i 'm sorry , it 's got a gas , does n't burn gas , and also , you can
and as a result , it 's like a water that 's inside of the water , and there 's also going to
so , you know , it 's not there yet to explain that in detail
and it looks a little bit like it 's going on , a
i mean , there are two types of
so , you know , there 's diatoms , we 're hardwired to be in the case of
and you do n't have in a structure in a structure , and it 's like
and that 's what most people who are built , in the world , they 've been built in , sort of ,
and of course , there are only today , as i said before , just in the day , at the same time , that was even more popular than our
and so this is what the solar cell will be as if it 's a
i mean , in fact , the
i mean , the machine is also a
i mean , by the way
i mean , it 's called the lester
that 's when they found out there ,
and it 's a point of two million dollars a little bit
and it 's got to be very affordable , it has to be forced to be , but it also has to be , because it 's always possible , because it 's got to be , because there 's a lot of time because it
and so at the same time , what the hell are doing is , say , are going to
so , in the end , it 's a little bit like this , and it 's like
i mean , it 's really a product that
so , you can see there 's the numbers down there , you know , just
and , one , nine percent , one point is nine percent , which is nine percent , which is six years ago , which is six years ago , one point six years ago
so this is very , very little , and it 's very
i mean , this is a
i can see you can see that
so , there 's another trend that 's really happening now , and that 's what i 've done with you here .
but in fact , we had three percent three years ago , and when i started , i 've heard yesterday , and by five years old , eight percent , and last year , and that 's
so , this year , at the age of the year , we
now , when you take the eight years , eight years old , if you want to do that , in the eight years , you can say , `` well , '' you can talk about this , of course , to have a weather , you know , over the course you have the weather
and we are the ones
and we 're able to fly it at the same time that
so , you want to see something
and that 's the way that i 'm going to do the top or the
and a little bit of the one thing that is , our weather is not just felt , but unfortunately , because we 're doing it , because we do
and that 's because that 's the good thing that is , that 's good news , and it 's good to be the power that 's a program to go to a program to go and find a
so in fact , i 'm going to go
and that is the one that we have in there , and it 's
i mean , we 're going
and we 're doing the right ones on the back between the surface of the
i mean , that 's called
and the t t , we 're going to sit down from far to go to finland in
in fact , a lot of a hundred hundred hundred meters of data , and the surface of the air , as it turns out , how they react to our things we 're
and so , that 's why i 've been trying to , because we 're just talking about the second
and so , a great job ,
so , if you want to do this , of course , like that ,
so this is very good . it
so here 's a couple of dinosaurs in this one
and that 's what 's going to happen in the last week
and in mongolia , the weather stuff , of course , is special , critical degrees , is more
and they did n't know what the hell had never been doing
and i 've just been shown in there , and i 've just got there
now , you know , you 're not supposed to be the
so we were also in africa .
so , you know , for example , you 've got to go back to boston , the first time you 're going to go , and the main ones are
so , you can also ask yourself , is this is all about africa , that is all of africa , and then this is all about africa , you can ask for a idea of a question , to ask a question , to be a question , to be a question to ask ,
and then i said , well , what do we do at this ? what is
and what are we going to do in
and in the end , we had been done at the end of
now , the main day he did n't go
and the whole thing that came out of the time went out , and the
and one of the time , he said , `` the graduate day , '' in the same time , then he could be
i do n't know that bad .
so , you know , there was a lot of criteria , and we
i mean , this is the prototype
we did n't know what i should do . '' i should n't
i mean , what we do today , which is a little bit more confusing in the gulf of
and what we 're doing today , that is what we 're going to do today , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , or
and what we 're doing today is what we 're going to do
so , of course , we
so , we have to get rid of the
so ,
and that 's where you are , in fact , there are all of them , to 10 , 10 to them ,
now , we 're using all of the entire population of over five million
now , with that the customers talk about what we 're talking
and we have to do that to do the whole
so , we 're a canadian designer , which is from the germans , and of course , that is going to be the germans in all , and of course , that 's where it is , and
and it 's also more nuanced , and it 's got to get money , and it
and the question is , do you want to go
so , do you want to
we 're going to do bigger
i mean , there are diatoms , there
this is , what do you do
so you 're going to go on the
i 'm going to go back to the
and so that 's what we 've done , of course , let
so , we 've done some of those things ,
and by the way , who used to have a couple of formal records that have been
and in the beginning , at the beginning , at the beginning of the
so , the population of the german population has been put it in six million dollars a week when the fourth year were stolen , and he was basically offered , and the population had him made a donation . he
so it 's actually used to be the most amazing thing in the middle of the night and the other companies that used to do , but whether i think we were n't going to do
so , we were in tokyo , in
so , we were , and we 're listening to the past , in san francisco with
and so that had played a very small
so , these projects , unfortunately ,
and so there 's also
and we 've won , we 've
and i do n't have a picture because that 's not what we do n't have to do is
so in america , now , in america , now , in america , the first semester of
so , we have three piece of
and so with a way , to do that , with a way , with a
and that 's a big success , but at the same time , you do
so they 're not used to be the clients who had ever been , because
and why did n't it ?
and we know that , we know
and it was n't the right or the fda had to go to a long period of time , or in america , you know , you could n't have seen the last 30 years to
and so , in fact , the people who 've got , however , have the basics of people have said , `` again , again , again , a
and so , you know , there 's no way that you can do that
and it was actually very heavy heavy quality of marketing that 's going to get over the way back : you say , ``
and that 's good at
and the pilot used to get the year at the year , free , called the
and last year , we 've only got a little bit of the
we 're going to do this , half a million
i mean , that 's bad
and that 's the framework that 's called
so it 's true that is beautiful , if i look at the age of the passengers , and all the laughter , and all the things , and we do n't really have advertising , because the mouth is , and they say , `` eat it with your friends , the same and the rest of the family . in the family , the family . '' at the family . in the family . '' in the family . in my family
so , we 're really amazing .
and what i 'm going to do is again and again , i have to do with them ,
and you 'd better be able to do more
and we 've got this , we 're going to have a solar system
and that 's actually not true that 's
so , we 're using advertising
and that 's been an art project that 's going on , that 's
and there 's been doing this , and it 's done with this island
i mean , it 's a difficult market to
and you also have to put yourself in a sense of money , does n't give you
but what we 've actually done is xml , but the internet has changed a lot of change that is going on , and it 's all about the
and the main unit of this is very , very , very , very , very close to 10 to the
i 've got three here .
and they 're two active , one of the black , the one , the one , the one ,
this is where six of 10 of them
and so that 's what we 're going to do when we 're going to control it , if
i hope to be able to do it again , again , again ,
so what , at the end of the airport , scott , the apollo ridge , after the catholic palace in paris and five , he said , `` the streets go to the top of the
and the name is beautiful .
so , we 're also making some math
i mean , we do n't find
so , to do that , we find great , it 's great to
i mean , we have the
i do n't think that 's
so , it 's a little bit , and it
and so that 's a bit like that , that 's a bit of
now , there 's no other thing . there 's
so , there 's a real effect that are easy to control it and hard to control .
and in fact , the point is , in fact , is the situation , or of course , is at the point
so , we 're going to
i mean , it 's an icon of
and they have the power to be able to do
so , it 's just going to ask the question of what we 're going to do about
and how much money we 're going to be in
and so what do we do for this ?
i mean , what else 's supposed to be
and i 'm thinking , you know , i 've been asked to tell you something to say to me , to me , where i wanted to say , `` the rejection collection , where i wanted to confess , '' by the way , i have to go through it too , very little , dead
so i 've been at the age of three years of time when i went through the island of an iphone , and that all of the most profound things that i 've ever done , that 's how i 'm going to
and at that time , there was a computer simulation of what 's happening in the money , and did n't know what to do with it , and almost almost did . ''
and so that 's what they 've brought me to do the same thing
and i 've been doing this for three years of surgery , and now i 'm doing this in the hope of doing a long future in the future . ''
so , yes , is that true ? british seconds , i 'm finished , thank you
it 's
so , thank you very much
and this is my three dots that i 'd like to talk to you in the morning
and what are we going to do today , at least ,
now , how are we going to
i mean , what do we do ?
i mean , what is the point of
i 'm going to start with our first
and the first part of this is a little bit
and so it 's also to be able to show out the challenges
and in a couple of years ago , i 've been more difficult to talk about this ,
so , we have a problem with today , every child , know
i mean , we 've got
so it 's worth it , and it 's still going to happen to the cause of the population , for example ,
and all of these things have grown up
and if you can see it in a certain long way , looking at the age , for example , that would be a very short event in the history . ''
and so you ca n't imagine where it 's kind of going to be different than it 's going to go back and go back
and you know the climate crisis , the last mile years .
and some people say , well , at the same time , we got a lot of times what we 've done for the
and that 's what you can look at , you know , `` well ,
so you can also say , who 's going to say ,
and you can also say , you can say the ocean is far
so , you know , if you 're working on a little bit closer to try to really work , really , to challenge the things that really makes it , to do it , we have a problem of doing something , at heart disease . health
i mean , it 's because it 's about 30
i mean , it 's in addition to our cities in our cities , in a way , like , you know , in
i mean , it 's also about the most important , but it 's also
and if you think about the himalayas , the large hadron collider , and they 're going to keep it out of the water that are going to
i mean , it 's not about the planet going
so the planet is the most important thing that we do , but there 's been a lot of the
i mean , for instance , but it 's about us to be the people who are going to be a lot of the most significant life
i mean , it 's about loss of
we 're going to have the deserts
and that 's not going to be
and that 's the ocean , which is an essential part of the cotton ,
i mean , where does that come from ? ''
and all of the great things , say , `` i 'm going to find out that there is a certain kind of thing in the
i mean , what we 're doing in the earth , what we do .
so it 's not just that the oil and the vessels and the storms and the minerals , but also , the lack of resources , it 's just unacceptable
so , we 're just going to look at it , so we can use it so much of this , to be able to use less of the
so this is what we 're going to do is to reduce the rise in the entire field of the global supply chain .
so this is the challenge , not just climate change , not only , if you 're a pregnant , two or a half or a car , but it 's
i mean , over to
i mean , our technology tends to change
so , once again , we 're going to take a look at the rate of the 11th , and digging up , and there are still on the economy that are now in the developing world that are going to be so endemic to
now , in a high school , there was a bunch of time in the human history , three million
i 'm going to be around there ,
and that 's what 's going on ,
so , it 's very , very , distributed down in the earth .
now , it 's more than more than us today more than we are more than the earth 's life than the earth
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , look at africa , you do n't
so , of course , we 're hardwired to change the implications of us , and the coral , the air has been too much better in the last decades , but it 's basically because we have this stuff in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are doing less and less and less . they
and therefore , i 'm going to discuss the genetics that we see from , of course , afghanistan , africa , wherever you 're looking at , you 're looking at the top of the american , and then you see where the resources are
and that 's because there are particularly colorful , which is , what is , you know , there are a lot of resources , where the world 's
so , if you want to do that , then we have to get started with the subject
and so we need to change , the ecological borders are everywhere , the population is everywhere . ''
and that is what we 're doing here at the same time that is n't going to
and this is what happens to the german japanese , as he said , the world needs a lot of care of all , but it 's not for
and that 's where we 're going to do , at least in the average life , we
and that 's
and so that was kind of an interesting
and i always think that you need to understand it , it 's worth going to change the way to change what 's going to
so even though i 'd say to myself , it 's worth going to be a way of life , such as possible , to get
i mean , it 's always , again , from the most end , you 're going to make sure you 're an honest , i
i mean , what 's actually going to
and what we have to do is we know , we 're going to share the world in our countries that have a lot of the world , the lack of life , in terms of income in terms of
and here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , you know , you know , i do n't know how to do this as good as
i 've had it in there .
and the way that you have , and ,
so we 're working on a lot , and
so that 's on the side of the room , and it 's too much for a while . it 's
so i 'm also going to work
and on the other hand , we 're going to do this more
i mean , what 's a good life ?
and how can we define that ?
so , i 'm going to come up with a
so what i 've been talking about , and what i 'm going to say is i 'm trying to be here , and here 's what you 're going to be here , but here 's what is going to
and there 's important to understand that life 's worth of two aspects . it
i mean , it 's the value of the quality of consciousness in how i 'm going to eat .
i 've got a roof on top of that
it 's like to me
but i , i think , can i be able to get
and so , you know , how is it going to come from me ? how are i going to
so , i 'm going to be the same quality
and then i 'm going to put two words that are important in the right place . ''
i mean , this is a
so , the needs of the very fundamental dimension of human development , where we 're going to be able to do things
and if we can predict our needs , we 're going to be happy
and i do n't need to tell you , needs to be dangerous or not sustainable
i mean , without any sense of reference , not
i mean , what are
and if you can see different scientists , i 'm just called you to two
and you can see , of course , the needs of the needs , but need a lot of security to
now , for example , to go , for example , to be involved , to be successful , to
so it 's got a little bit about what to do with money
so , at a big part , you do n't have , but the question is , how can i look like i live in my life .
i mean , i 'm in the second part that i 'm
so , you can
and the strategy that i 'm going to use is that i 'm going to pay for this needs to
so this is where it 's going to be here , and that 's what i 'm going to do with you to do with a
and so i can need a lot of money to do or make
and i 'm also using some behavior that i 'm going to get my
now , that 's what i do with my values , with the resources that i have made of the possibilities that i
so if i have a little bit of money , i want to try to share my needs , to be as if i 'm making a lot of
so first of all , you 're going to go back , and it 's just the roof on its head , food , and then it 's
and this is where it 's going to be able to do a lot or a little bit of a little bit , you can be
so , if we 're going to get all the strategies that will be given to my needs , to get rid of my needs , we 're talking
and that 's
and that 's kind of , i was
we 're going to do now , what is going to do now
and how is it going to be like
i mean , there 's just a couple of
so , of course , you have to find some of your own
and the evidence of that is based on a technical way , which is that i 'm also known about technology , and also , in a political way . in a political way . also ,
now , what can we do
now , what can we do
what do we do ?
so , where do we want to go
and the photos at the beginning , they 've been saying , the danger is that we 're going to be more and more resources . ''
so at the end of the quality of life , again , the effects are always worse , and the effects are going to be coming out and
and if we can do it in the other direction , which is less likely to be a little bit higher , but less in a way that lives are connected to a higher quality of life .
and there 's one of my favorites , maybe some of you who know , some of the smartest things about this topic , is more quality of life on
and so this is a lot of technology , and how can i make all of these things that we 're using the use of the computer , the rhythm of the car , the fuel cells , how can i make
and i 'm able to create today , so i can create a new way , and i can build
now , to do a more special amount of life , to do more of
and i 'm talking about other teachers , the most amazing thing , which is the most important thing that 's going on , and that 's where we 're talking about today , which is where we now have been thought of what is also going to go
and then , where are the needs
i mean , what services could i be
and how do i have to do it with a bit of a
and it 's not just a little bit less with a little bit less , and it 's not
i mean , there are a few examples of that that can be
and in italy , in 2001 , there is going to be a
and it 's actually built up in seven buildings , and it
so , in fact , of course ,
and if you ca n't take away , you can go back all the time , and if you 're going to pay attention to it , and in a little bit , you do n't get so much less resources than everything else , and you 're very much less resources with all the time , and in fact , that 's very much less resources with all the time you 're going to do with the
and also , i have a lot in all of our own , like , how do i do it
we 've got a little book that has written a beautiful book
and then , as he turns out , how hard it is , is really , from the way that i think , is really
i mean , i 'm going to take a look at the next one , and then i 'm going to get to the other people , and then
so , you know , you know , you know , you 're kind of like , you know , you know ,
so , in the most magnificent act i 'm going to do , i 'm
and when i was in the exhibition that i started , we wrote a couple of years
and then you can wait for the letter to the letter , `` i 'm going to email '' ] `` my eagle song is
so , for example , i 'm going
so , i can do a lot more .
so , that 's productivity growth , we 're going to go back to it in
now , i do n't really have time to
so i 've been doing this , and i
and there 's good examples , fast food , for example , in fact , i really think of the quality of the quality and quality of the way into the
and you can do a more sophisticated amount of life
i mean , one of my favorite
and yet , there 's been something that 's happening is that the average average average of us in germany , in about a lot of thousands of
now , you can start to count on
and so , two , hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of people had employees ,
i mean , we 've got the
so , we need to get ourselves
and there 's less than coming out there , and you do n't have to
and we need a lot of care that 's going to help us out of all of us with these few things together
and i 'm interesting to say , i 'm interesting , but i 'm interesting to perhaps even more humble , from the sun , you know , i 'm not going
so the next example is going to be used
and it 's a magnificent
and so , you know , like , star systems , maybe , in a way , 20 years ago , in some
so , in the meantime , there are more people if you think that you can think
so if you think about it in
and so , to do that , you do n't work with these things that are going to work with this beautiful thing here , which has been a few hundred years ago and still used to be a few years ago , and then about the latest centuries that we 're going to
i mean , that 's how it 's going to be used better
i mean , this is probably the question of justice , that
and what i 've shown you to do is i 've shown to you as if this is what you see is that this is what you see
and so at all , at the same time , all the time that you can be able to be able to be able to
i mean , it 's not just a quality of life , because many of us have come to have a
and it 's a big challenge to the economy , the company , those products , these products , really , we need to make a good life to create a good life to deal with a lot less resources .
and that 's exactly what i think is going to do with the big economic system that 's also about to growth in , that 's what
and if you read a little bit of the protein , it 's more than lower , so it 's about lower , so it 's going to get a breath back down to the
so , yes , it 's a crisis that goes to my view , and , after , what we 've been thinking about a lot of things that have been thinking about all of us , that is the numbers for childhood , and you find that there 's all the world for all the way down to
and there 's no reason to do this , we know how to do it , like how i would like , of course , from how it felt
and in part , that 's exactly what 's
now , this is a third five , which is about eight percent growth in total years to be
i mean , this is a eight percent , which is what china is
so , you know , like , you know , where we were sort of like
and in fact , when the five hundred and worse , of course , is even eight percent of
so this is one percent of the time that we 're going to do , and
and you 've got to get rid of it , which is n't that if we were going to zero zero growth , we do n't have a zero growth , that 's not going to do that , in the next year , and we
and that 's what we 're going to do as well , and
so this is not so hard that , because you see these numbers that are not going to happen to be in the same way of life itself . it 's not more of
now , the economy is growing up , but the quality of it is more likely to be in the countries in which countries are
and by the way , the jobs are also without growth , and it 's not as common as the same as all the time we 're going to do , and how they all belong to
so , that 's just not true , and then you have to get yourself in the economy
and it 's always coming again and again and again , like , like , like , like the other , or the week , i 'm going to think about it in a trend , a bigger history with this topic
and in fact , nasa has edward edward , who did n't have a ph.d. at home in his 20s , so he said , `` good life the great economy is the good history of the great life , the
so that 's why we 're not going to do , and not about the reason to do not access to the most important deal , not to reduce greenhouse gases in terms of
and for me and for those who are also there , and for china , also for china , to be there ,
and this is actually going to be used by even more adept at the same time that we 're going to grow there , and we 're just looking at that level , and this is a level we 're going to be more and more
so it 's also going to be
and it needs to be
i mean , you need to say , ``
and it does n't just have to be the growth , but we should really look up and measure , like , how is it actually the quality of life , is going to
what is the investigation ?
this is what we 're going to
so , of course , how about the state
we 're going to do that ,
so , we need an underlying fundamental part of what 's going to happen to the climate crisis and not
and who are especially by the men who do , you know , who are also aware of them , but
so , what you 're doing , what , at the end of the day , we
and that 's what you could do with
now , the resources are lost , and it 's also the resources that are n't going to
and you 've got to get to do that all of the things that you need to create education , to create education , to create a
so that 's kind of , you need to have some kind of thing .
and so , that , if you get more or less , in all levels of life , we can work hard , we can work hard , we can help us , what are we going to be able to ask , what do we do , what is the good thing to do ? we 're going to be
i mean , what do we need , and what do we
now , you do choose to have the right economic
i 've had a chance of thought i
and at the end , of course , what 's the most successful percent of all of us are still in the direction of the way that we
i mean , unfortunately , no one
so , if you look at the pattern , if you look at the evolution of the last 20 years , it 's still not going to be
so , the political power is not going to be , and the power is not going to be growth , but it 's the question of how to do with that , and is that we have a good
i mean , it 's a bit of
and then you would like to go to the
so , you 're heart , brain , and , for the same time , we 're going to
it 's very much
now , i 'm a believer
and i love this city . i
so , the city has so much to tell the
i 've had one of those a couple of years ago . right
so , in fact , there 's something we
i 'm going to be able to follow this into something , and i 'm going to
and you 're going to do it with the top of the
and that 's kind of the key code that 's going to be here in the middle of the city , and a lot of the city
and that 's a different story
and it was in a hot newspaper hospital in southern england , nevada
and then it turns out that there is so a man pretending to be in his shoes in his
so it 's not going to be
now , it 's thicker , he does n't know that with the heat ,
so he 's put it out , and he 's going to take it out a little bit of a jeweled , and it 's a lot of a lot of
and he 's going to get that on the finger , and he 's got a camera out there , and he has
and it 's the one who 's going to say , ``
and so this number you can see here is here , which is , here 's where you 're seeing here at the core of the
and so , one of the companies that we 've developed is
and it 's because a person or other people knows
so , he has the original idea that he also has to add
so , they have a
and he 's going to be good , he 's going to be , `` well
i 'm going to go up to the
we 're doing a lot of thousands of jobs in time in the world of the world in
this is how much we can think about
i do n't mean to do something new , which is n't there if
and then , maybe it would have the question of being able to do with some of
and if you do n't know , if you do n't know , it 's for a chance
and i 've been trying to try and make a lot of work for a
this is something that has been wrong , or my physical therapist does n't work or engineering , or whatever .
so , you know , little memory ,
so , what is the opportunity to
so , you 're going to get out of the
and that 's what the power can be , and what i 'm going to
and one of the other thing was , in fact , is a lot of the most popular design technology ,
and that 's how you can be able to be able to be creative , if it 's going to
so i want to show you a few examples here
and that 's actually how they used to be in the safari business , and that 's how they made a
and i 'm going to give you
i do n't know my son , not my
so it 's just a little bit more open , so it 's the woman through
now , i had plants , and the whole day , when all the bikes , i would have a break in my inbox and i could n't see the other car . i could
and it turns out who 's wrong , right ? it 's
so , they 're
i mean , the scores are
now , i 've been born , and two years ago ,
and so , if you 're going to do this , half the
now , the last one , i did n't say that i
i mean , the young woman in the world
i mean , if you 're a man , you do n't have a
i mean , if you 're a woman , you do n't have to do
now , people are creative , as well , we
and i wish to myself , and i dream about the fact that we all have to use more of
i mean , a lot of us are in a
so that does n't have to be that
and why not just do anything , do n't
we 're going to do that , by the way , that we 've got to get out there , and maybe we 've got to have
we do n't know how to do it differently , as well as a little bit of a
so there 's such a company , and there 's a company , which
so for example , the thing that has traditionally , for instance , is that , for example , who have this dome , or the ones , they 're going to go out of the
so , one thing , right ?
and as you go to the coffee store , instead
so , like that .
and so we do n't have a framework of
and so this is already , right ? is
and if you ca n't read the mobile phone ,
so if you 're eating yourself , you 're going to die ,
so , for example , but
and it 's going to be
and i 'm going to talk about one of the clients , or the way that i 'd smell , and say , okay
i 'm going to do that .
and so , as a result of the ottoman empire has been the current center of the ottoman empire
and as a result , most of the time , the other thing
so if you were three months on the edge of the room , you 're
and so , the one was the exact same time they had to eat
and it 's a kind of building buildings , and the restaurant is very small , so the chefs were going to do all
so , it was too deeply
so , you 've got to think , what do we do
and how do we solve the problem
and we 're not going to be faster at the
i mean , this is a
so in the table , if you 're going to have a blank slate , you 're going to put
and so that the way in which the body stores that you could put on your home system at the time that you
this is how it happens
and so i think a creative idea , and perhaps also with the most
now , there 's a person who is n't just talking about now .
so this person is , of course , to the god of the most complex , the
so , in fact , we 're running out
and then the second day , this is going to come back , and four days
so , i have a company called fire in order to go to the u.k. , and you may have heard
and thank you very much time , you know , let 's thank
now , the people who are coming to us
and the kids are full , and it 's going to go to the people , and they 're going to go back into very , because of course , to be part of
this is why not , now , is n't going to use some kind of creative and creative
now , sometimes i think it 's all
and it comes out of a very pragmatic way of thinking about how to do that , you might know .
and so what we did is that we do n't really know that at the moment , it 's not really good , but that you do n't need to save it in a way that
now , if you 're going to
so , you know , we 've got the different kinds of , more , and
i mean .
and why does n't i be a bit of a car in the car that if you
so , for example , in terms of ways there are ways to make creative
and all of this is just going to do that , in terms of humor , with joy , things that 's wrong with
so it 's funny , it
now , in my office , i was in my office to
and that 's in front of me , an
and so , we have a lot of research on top of our
now , he 's going to be on the left left on the right , he 's joy , and i 'm going to tell you that , i 'm going to tell you that , you say ,
so i 'm going to look at it , look at me , big eyes ,
so , in the moment , i 'm really , right ? '' he 's right ,
i do n't mean that is that
so , why is that what we 're doing , what is it that we do
and so that 's a little bit more wrong ,
so if we are anxious , if we use our talents , what we like to do what we like to
now , the ones that are used for , but
and that is the most important day that when a particular day of view , if you look at what 's going on
and it 's the first day in the week , and it 's the point that 's going to be
and so we have a little bit of a day
so that 's how it ends
so , you know , you know , that 's what you
so at the heart rate , it 's not only a day to go to the
so if you 're going to have the most beautiful time of the year , you
we 're going to do that , at the top of the
so , how is it so
so , how are we all of these
and then , one of the time capsule was the first time that was going
i 'm going to go , `` you know , and i 'll give you a
and at the same time , on facebook , where facebook is all over the social networks , you
and as i go through this , i 'm going to go through the water
i 'm going to do a lot of business and i 'm going to
now , what have been doing in , like , in the case , what is
and one day , i 'm going to buy one on the business with these guys
and the first sign you can see here , yeah , that 's actually a nice thing to do . ''
i mean , through the way , to do something like that ,
and i 'm like that , i 'm just saying that , by the time , five of five children , but i
i mean .
and i 'm going to say , `` for instance , ''
so that their attitude is to imagine how it 's going to fall , and that 's still more and more
and there 's a chance to come up with that direction , and it 's not the following , it 's like jobs . it
and i do n't really think of the pink potatoes , and then we go , and say , okay , go on , you know
this is nice to my job , right
i mean , it 's stupid , even though it 's the pink chicken , it looks like most of them before .
so it 's nice to talk to you , which is n't beautiful , it 's not
this is the nest maintenance workers that are going to get a
and so , you 're going to fly out a bit of the lines that you would go
now , you do n't do it .
now , how does that leave us when we do n't change ?
so , in fact , the job , the content , is
and in the company , when we have a
and it might be in a system where we 're like most of us as well as the
so , the mouse goes up in that wheel , and it 's going to go , and finally , it 's going to slow down , and then that 's going to get out of the
and what does the mouse do ?
and it 's not something that you do n't know anything about it , it 's
and again , again , again , again , again , again , again , you know , maybe again , the next day ,
and that 's pretty nice , and they 're doing this , here 's what 's going on there , so it 's always going to go and
and what that means as though , actually , is probably the mouse eventually , you know , is the
now , it 's going to get a bit of
and i was going on for a lot of years ago that i was going to go home from
and again , as the street under me , it was very , black holes in my eyes , and i need to stay . i have to stand .
and then the next day , i went to a doctor , and so i thought , what is there
so , first of all , i was going to say , i used to be
that 's the thing you 're going to do with
and i looked up in my bedroom to try and check that , and i looked at that , and i worked with three weeks ago , and i kind of
and for 20 years in the middle of the day and some people who have been thinking of the first time in the early days , we might be
we also have thought , what are we going to do with other things for jobs
and then i started to go back , to learn , again , to pay attention to other people , looking at the time i 'm going to talk to me with my family 's
and so , unfortunately , whether it 's not going to do n't any new unit in my job ,
and i realized that now , i 'm going to talk about the two kinds of groups that
and i 'm going to go back like , `` and , '' and other things , '' and other things , but i want to give these stories apart , to study experiences that
so that 's not all that way .
and i realize that i have to realize that this is how to make
and sometimes it 's really going to get really going to get all of this sort of thing that came out of the boat , so that it 's got very close to the hospital by the time when he had a heart attack ,
so at the same time , i said , `` you know , i 'm going to go with you , you know , you know , i
i 'm going to be in
and so with that , with a way , with a little bit , at the right time , but eventually we 're going to
that 's what happens
this is where we 're all going to
and you get down , but it 's a curve that is more nuanced , but it 's a kind of
and you can get four percent in the last 10 years , which is nearly 64 percent , that 's nice , it 's nice , it 's
so , of course , of course , with
and this is something that i 'm going to be , has to be that way
what is that ? is that
and that 's all this is in all
so , you do n't , in germany , that
and so , for example , food , which is
so this is kind of seeing here on the left-hand side . right
so at the bottom of the diseases , at least , a hundred percent of the last 10 years in the last 10 years ,
and that 's the number of people who are
so , the amount of
and it 's going to happen all sorts of quotes , what can we do with this subject
and so , do n't want to get some kind of things like this , like ,
now , that 's what 's
so someone who was told that , no alcohol , it 's not a solution
i mean , what is the solution ?
and so , what is it that , then , how does it make us healthy ourselves , and then
so that 's what i 've done in the last
and i 've been thinking , `` well , how are you going to be a little bit more like
so , i 'm an artist who 's job , the job is to say what 's going to be done
so , there are a lot of other things that are important , family , health , thinking and so forth
i mean , of course , is that we 're going to spend the biggest part of our work in
so , if we do that , why do n't we do it , that does n't make that thing to do that , and then
and that 's why i 'm going to tell you , as you get to do , '' i 'm going to do
and you can do this little thing that you 're going to look at
and for example , to democracy , to be freedom , is
i mean , how do n't you get the rules out of
and what is that in the environment , what is it that i do
i mean , that 's the freedom that i 'm going to do , what i want to
and so , of course , the average age is , of course
i mean , the more of them , the
that 's what do i do ?
i mean , this
i mean , these are the areas
so , you can see everyone at the time .
now , i had to end up with me for the self , and i would go through it ,
i mean , can i have the
it 's in the environment
and that is , sometimes , i 'm going to be in a meeting with my laptop , which is that i need to get
i mean , the
so , the freedom that i can take to do what i think is important to be important
and so , how do i do
i mean , this
i mean , the last
and then there are other people , and then again , again , again , that 's why i
i mean , that 's why you 're much more
and then i 'd also like to get quite a answer to that kind
so , you want to find out
now , who do n't have ,
and of course , if you can , have you going to be able to get rid of you , maybe i 'm going to make you
and you 're going to be in them .
now , what are we going to do with
i mean , every one of them has put their
now , that 's a little bit about
now , it 's filled with puppies , with the gold , with two , with all kinds of
so what are we going to
and for the most important thing , we 're
so if we 're in the hospital or the end of a life ,
and what did i have to do with my
and by the way , by the way , i think , on the most part , you can
and so , what do we do with our school system is so my first question , to me , but it 's every day . '' on
and so , i 'm going to do
i mean , they
so , here 's another thing to do with that
and i 'm going to tell you about
and i 'm going to do that , but i 'm going to
and that was the most successful thing that was sent to the united states as a woman who had
and the voices that they realized that this was kind of said , `` it could n't be used to be able to
and below the roofs of the boreal , the wild trees , the most vulnerable , the doors of the
and so at that time
and so that 's what 's going on , okay , so if we 're not going to go ,
so , we do n't take it out there ,
now , look , how do you have a little bit like
and so they used to do it out for a long period of the day , where they were almost
we had only one of the most interesting ones that were already in the way to get it down , and the way it says to me , is going to give me three days to me . '' three days
and so fine , you name , you know , you 've got rid of you , i 'm going to go , please , go up
we 're going to go back to the
and again , look at the bottom of the teeth in the wall of the temple of the ice sheets made a lot , and it 's going to be on the left side
so , you know , think , look at that , in a way , a
i mean , it 's
so , again , it 's going to go back to a flat place , up on the wall of the
we 're thinking , oh , who 's going to say two , you know , something else . '' you
so , at the night , at the same time , this is the one , the one that 's going to be there , and
and at the end of the day , after the six different types , when you see six different types down it , they
so , you know , you thought that it takes us for a long time that we think , do n't
and then , after that , we went down to the ward down to
and you 've got one that you 've got , and you 've got
and we 've been taken out of the
and i like this idea of everything that 's going to be , what 's going to do , and we 've got
and sometimes it 's mostly resources , sometimes it 's not a lot , sometimes it 's not a
and so we can do something that 's going to
and we have no idea of power that we have made to make the world into the world . ''
and if you think that might be a good thing , you know , here 's what you 're
and the spring comes in the spring
so it 's coming
and what we do in , we know , we know , we 're going to know where the snow is there , you 're going to get out of the
and then , in some ways , there 's some sort of
and we 're going to go through this one that we 're going to pick
and there 's the grain of that grain , and then we have these lumps and
i mean , there 's some animals that are going to eat
i mean , there 's people who then eat the products that eat it later .
i mean , it 's going
so if you think about it , maybe that 's not going to change that 's when it 's going to be a fear and
and of course , this is a threat , but also , of course , in fact , in fact , of course , in fact , in the middle of the flower , the connection of the flower with
and there are these studies that show that , to 52 percent of our food , we could n't have any bees , if we did n't have any bees
and that sounds like that , because it 's so normal to us , and we ca n't do it , and we do n't think about
and there was a very interesting film that came out with a very interesting movie , which is ,
and i 'm just going to look at it , look at that
and now , what we 're looking at is at the ted conference , which is just talking about bees with the work of bees , in the sense of bees that makes it
and that 's what he is doing with a school in school , and he 's going to talk a little bit about
and so , let me go
and thank you very much .
we 've just got to do this , and the only thing you did n't know
now , i 'm going to show you with this project , which i can relate to something else about the
and this also kind of a little bit of a set of a little bit of being a little bit of
and i think that the reason that you can get involved in front of the time you 're going to be able to focus on today 's talk today to talk to you in the morning that you
this is not what i do n't want
so , you may be able to bring it to you , to try to get you to be able to start out of this charter , or a sense of empathy , and i 'm going to get them to think about
so my name is thomas , and i 'm born at a very young woman , father with five children , and i 've been doing a lot of them , and i 've been working with five children , and have been trained in the middle of the day ,
and i 'm a member of the hospital in the middle class , and i went
and the work now , now , at the same time , we 're working on top of the
so we 're living in the garden , in agriculture , and we 're in the
and it 's really , of course , it 's really a multinational trove of crochet of
and our daily classroom is a little bit , a parallel , a quiet thing , a
so it 's also going to be the
i mean , it 's almost a more
and yet , for free , you know , the old greeks had the connection between honey , because , and the most powerful feat ever
and in a wonderful note about this , as a result of that , he shows how to the supreme court to get rid of his body to the landfill , so that he can
and yet , you know , it does n't go to the ground , but they send them all the blue bees and put it out of the mouth in the mouth and again in the mouth and again that there 's the words as honey in the nest entrance
so , a picture of
now , i 'm going to talk to
i mean .
i 'm going to go
so , i come to the project
and one of these things , which is the first day that most of my students with me built up with all the time up to be around for
and at the schools in schools , we 're in the ministry of schools in the school age , or in the middle ages , or in the
and for example , we used to go up to an underdog , or
and the teacher that came to this project is to be with me in the class , and we 're looking at a very big place for
and at the same time , the windows can be able to see something that
and in all of the things that the bees who are then there are going to be through this where you can see , and then
now , here 's what it is going to be
and that 's
so that 's what happens all of me to the mast . ''
and so i 'm going to do this , and i 'm going to do this , and i 'm going to do this , and i 'm going to
this is something that is about to be on this one of these
so , of course , we 've got to have here at ted , and here 's where we 're going to be here at the
and so , you know , it 's a little bit like
and it 's the honey inside of
and you 're going to do that when you 're bad , and if you ca n't
and that 's
so this is what it looks like
and then it comes back , and then it looks a little bit like this , and then it 's going to start all the way up to life ,
this is something that has happened to
and i know , ladies and gentlemen , these are the bees in there , and then , in fact ,
it 's not the people who are
so you 're familiar ,
now , you do n't find your
and that is the most important task from the most important task , when he 's going to be able to put this into that that he 's going to
now , it 's not going to be with these two mouths
so , you 're going to be sad ,
so , you 're going to start
and they say , `` oh , you 're going
now , you hear that
and you can almost take a more higher higher than if you 're working in your spouse with a queen
so now it 's going to be
you know , ladies and gentlemen , now , in a night , now now , we now have the need now now to create a new person , and that 's actually not going to be done , not in the way , without the
and so that 's the people , and then that 's the people , and then the next night
and no one guy would not have the people in six weeks after six weeks
it 's got a lot of life that 's
and that 's
and in this first night , they get out of one of these steel , like a pencil , and put it into this kind of into
i mean , it 's called the `` girl ''
and every one of you who have been on in high school , is like , what 's going to go
so , you have to have access to this kind of light ,
so that 's true
this is something that has happened to
and so , this one , which , in a sense , that 's what 's going to be in a
and what that is , and this is where the first three days of the genetic
now , it 's got to be used to a
i mean , they know what
and immediately , on the top of that , on the genetic level of the genetic
and you 're going to have the same amount of energy coming out of
so , you know , we 've just seen this before , what we eat , which is what we eat , which is what
so , the queen 's the thing , the queen is really interesting
this is three days , in a second place ,
i mean , this is what you can do
now , this is what you see
and then this cell is used to take the cell in a representative system , and it 's not going to be true because even the people are going to sit down , because of the people there are now whether it 's the right , because the people are going to be ,
we do n't , that 's what
and i 'm talking about ladies and gentlemen , that is a more general , or
and then , the email are eight minutes of every student in my school , three , eight five seconds are a queen , and that 's the queen
and on the day , if that 's going to happen , the teacher has to be the catalyst in the middle of the morning in the morning at the age of five o'clock , yes .
and then the mother says , `` oh , is the other guy , what 's going to
i 'm going to go to school . i
i mean , why , that 's
i mean , we have the queen
i mean ?
so , the morning , at the age of six in the morning
and then you take a look at the front porch , and that 's what you call them , which is what you call your ``
i mean , if you really , you can actually do this , you 'll
i mean , this is
and that 's
so , you have a little
and then you get the queen , and get the queen down .
and the first thing that this is what they call it , she makes their wings , and they have their own thing out there , who has a queen in their front door , they 're playing , you know
now , the people have now to make a
now , i 'm going to take you for five and five days
and you 're going to go back to the front end of
so , in the back , there 's a number of light from the people who
so after five days , this is the queen , and of course , the
and i think , `` well , you know , i 've seen a way that 's going to be
so , you know ,
i mean , what happens
so , that 's what we
and that is the queen , and he 's not going to do that at all the time , not to be able to go
and you 've already seen in your mind first time in your
and in the middle of this room , there are in a high school district now now , and seven in tens of thousands of books
and then the way that , as the child in the man is different than here , the queen is seven , and the number of men
so this whole thing is happening in a very interesting way in the
and then the drone is coming from the back of the two , and the queen is now the queen , now , this is what the hell is now at all of that , as you 're
and it 's also a sense to be able to be an
so when you 're finished , you 're going to go back with the blood sugar ,
and then the queen comes back , and it starts to get rid of them .
so there 's always a couple of students in the class that look at them immediately , and
this is also what the queen says .
i mean .
and then it starts to slow it to the project , at the same time , the ted talks , and the queen and the panties , and now it 's just in there
and then i 'm going to go on to the front end of this
and that 's the most fun thing from the outside of the face , and the next morning , i 'm going to show that these with the queen with these
now , there 's a look at the queen there
i mean .
and that 's called
and again , it 's still 10 to 12
and then this is coming , and this is , `` well , this is , these two
so , in a full jungle , in a record , and you can get the people there , and
so how many kids in the school
and i know , ladies and gentlemen , the children that have ever forgotten the first time ever
i mean .
and that 's not just that in the class , the students are all the time with the bees , but the whole school actually says , `` that 's in the class . '' and that 's
and the other thing is , if he knows something that he can see is if he 's going to be there for something to go to a place when he 's going to be a
and you can see , bees and wetlands in the world war ii , we 've been building , where the people who have carried out
so , a few months ago , in israel , that 's old years ago that people found out of the people that people were able
and we have a lot of culture in terms
and then , by the way that the bees were in the culture
so in india , in india , in egypt , in egypt , in egypt , in egypt
so they were all over the
now , the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are the result
and he can give you an illustration of an eye , which is an impostor , he
and i know , ladies and gentlemen , you know , that flowers or are the bees , and they do
i mean , you know , there 's something that you see there , in summer ,
and this out there , this is a green desert for the bees , the
i mean ?
and it can go to the students in the boardroom and put it into the plants , and there are no bees , and they look back , and look at the same time , and see how much better
and how long have you been on the verge of
and as long as you need to go back to you until you
and he 's able to be able
now , how do i have a
i mean .
and you know , what 's the case that the number is that in the area of the top you 're in the middle or the flat side
i mean , look , look at
now , it can be a mathematics -- that can be a
and i mean , ladies and gentlemen , he can actually take the research in the back of the most vulnerable aspects on the
and then he 's going to ask the question of how could he find out of the ibm 's best ever
and he realized that the bees realized that the bees are seeing in the back
i mean , know , ladies and gentlemen , the one in it , it 's
now , there 's a bee does n't
so at the university of college , who spent a lot of years in university at the university of university , which is that the bees and the bees are able to create a catalyst on the brink
and as a result of the net on the perimeter of the perimeter to make a violin , and you 're going to make a regular arm out there , you know , the bees , the seats , the seats , the seats , the
and you see , what are bees doing it ? what ? ''
and it 's very low-power 's nest maintenance workers , and the kids are losing their fear on
so there 's a responsibility for bees and the
and you learn that , you know , you 're learning how to do
and you get one of the things that you 're going to do in the same thing that is only
i do n't do the bees , and not the farmer at a time a year
and so , at the age of time , the only way
and you 're going to put them on the trees in the trees and
and that 's a line of music that 's a little bit about , you
and now you 're going to go back here in the summer that are beetles -- the bees are in the middle of the room , very sparse degrees , in
i mean , there 's a little bit there if
now , no , not the bees .
and you 've got the same in the field of
and you 're going to get the pollen , and by the way it 's going to turn it up , it 's going to
so , who 's who 's going to get involved in the most profitable way , that i 'm going to go back and be able to go up to a coffee store , and then to give you a
and of course , there 's a grid on it , and at the same time , with a joystick and so on
so , and , and then , ladies and gentlemen , the most important thing that the bees are doing is the bees of the bees , and we have to go to less than if the bees can not fly , or we had to go like the chinese in the
now , there 's a lot more of
and if you look at the top line , which is out there at the bottom line , it 's growing up to the rise of the
and this is the bee , and then you can see the bee , it 's going to
so now , the cow and then , the cow and then , is the plot of it , and it 's because you can
i mean ?
and then they put it back and see , `` oh , yeah , i 've got a big investor , you know , i 'm going to
and then there 's milk , and
i mean , that 's the
i mean ?
and at the end , at the end of the end of the bee , the bee tells us the things that we
i mean , you
and i 'm going to take a moment to go to the point
so my students are going to take each year if they 're going to build this joystick , and then they 're going to go
and that 's not that i 'm going to do that , but i 've had a student at the time , and i said , `` i 'm going to be in the e.r . '' i said , `` you
and then he says , `` well , '' he says , `` i 'm hot
so i 'm going to go out of the e.r . i 'm going
and i 've been in the age of five years in the middle of the five years , and
and i 'm like , i 'm not going to be able to talk more about the world 's work , but with the hands of the
now , yes , so , with that ,
and a year ago , and it was about to go to the
and more than the half said , `` yeah , that 's what we want to do
and what i 'm going to do is an incredible appreciation of it , and this is an incredibly valuable part of the city , the normal , and
now , you 're going to lose yourself , and you get it , you know , my students
so how do you get to that
and the question is wrong ,
and you have to say , how do you get to go to the
and that 's when i 'm also saying , this is the human being , the other person , and there 's a new kind of thing to
so he says , `` well , here 's how to do
so , at the end of a little poem , from a
and like the bee would be the sun through the sun that would be the sun through that the sun that would have changed the fields of the fields of the fields of the fields of the fields of the fields of the fields of
it 's very much
i mean , loving friends , in the world
and i 'm going to talk to
and this is my project , and my wife
i mean , it 's the struggle for a end of the female
so , in my eyes , the most successful crime in humanity , because it 's been known for
now , the society for women in the day to pay attention to each other
so , first of all , i 'm
so my name is , i 'm going to go out of
and i used to do it in a year 's
and i think you can not have me , i do n't have to
now , i did n't feel like
and so that 's why i was happy to know that i was in the moment that i thought , `` well , ''
now , this is what
and when you have a massive surplus over the atlantic ocean in the atlantic
and so on the back of the back of the ottoman empire , which is the most successful genocide in the last few years to prevent
and that was a little bit where i was more likely to be more than a literary conceit , as
and yet , i used to be able to find the interest of the media , and even a little human life that i could learn to make up the
and in fact , i 've been working on with her own groups of
and at the time , there 's a war between the north america and the natural world was
and in spite of all the instructions that we 've been , we 've been on the other side of the extracellular matrix of the world , which seems to us ,
and twice it was so we 've been building , and we put it together , and they look at their bodies that they see here , they 're using their bodies as a way to live in front of us ,
so , if you kill them , you 're going to get rid of
now , in this way , i could find a lot of
and at the time i had learned that in young years , that it 's not going to be
and yet , in fact , i do n't want to be lost
now , for example , the
i mean , the circular ones that
and it turns out to be true of the true values like this , and social
and that 's what the value are , which is worth to fight for a
so in a couple of years , i 've been back in this permian , with my wife ,
i mean , after that , we heard about these ninja female radio
and then when i heard about the number of women , the u.s. is the number of men , and i 've thought about how i 'm going to think of how to say , `` why do n't you have any kind of jargon in the shoes
and the idea that was born , and the most common job of islam is to give up the desire to do this
so we were looking at this , we had a lot of men in switzerland ,
and then we had to listen to this , but we would have thought , `` well , we have to be honest ,
now , i would love you through the
and so at the top of the international international international survey , we 've been building
and of course , of course , of non-lethal
and to do this , also , to make it , let 's just take it
so this is a lack of
and so , by the way , that 's how to reach around , and i put it into the desert
so , the very intense text images that i 'm not going to show you , but i 'm going to
so at the age of four weeks to the spring , at some point from their parents and the security chain , they 're going to go through the fields of the brain , with no instruments , with no instruments , with no instruments , without the instruments , but in order to be able to feed the food , but they need the name of law enforcement officials . ''
and what you 're going to do is to be a stick out of
i 'm going to make it a
i mean , if you 're going to get rid of them ,
and so , he grew up in body body and soul would be
and that was the first thing that we 're going
and that is where it 's going to
so it 's got to open it
and he 's never seen a nice woman to see
this is the one who said , `` oh , well , it 's not a problem
and you 're going to go through your penis with the car , and then you
and if you do n't do it , you do n't know , it
so you take a bike , and you throw it up .
i mean , that 's a
and it 's a third of the girl
now , you had this three months out of
so , in fact , his father had lost his
i mean , these are the main ones , also some of
i mean , most of them are
and if we said , `` how did you do this ? '' what did
and the most important answer that we have to do is we have to do this in
so , in fact , in the koran is all the opposite
and in three days , every morning , five years ago , in the morning , of course , as a result , the
we do n't seem to believe what to pray to you . '' they
and so they used to be very portable , to be a prisoner of the women who has been wrong wrong , and what you might be done , and you
and so now we had the pictures of the first sabbatical in the face of
now , we decided to leave his whole book , all the way to
so there were plenty of fun , two days ,
and we had the dawn of the site on our side , which is what we 've seen
and then , the great decision , which is the idea that i need to be , the idea is to protect all of the human
and in fact , the final thing that has happened was this new
and if you know africa , and you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's only that
i mean , it 's amazing , and that 's how we used to live in other
and again , again , again , there 's a lot of time , there 's a lot of research on the brink of the east coast of the country , which is to say that it 's a crime in the
and we were going to go back to their own
and there was a hundred hundred years
and where we 've come , we 've only open open ears , open arms , and the historical age of happiness . ''
and as we asked them to visit the country , the great rabbi of the cold , and so , you know , are you going to be all
it 's not going to be a lot of land that you
and he 's right .
so i 'm an ecologist , and i have to get you to get
so , he was , really , he had
and he said , if you 're going to get the ten impulses of the world to put one of the world into the table and try to do this , it 's a fountain . ''
so , and i went to papercutting in the backyard , where you 're going to get to the top of
and at the end of the book , at the same time , at the same time , the english professor , a
so , he was looking at the idea that was really excited about , as soon as we did it , we were going to do
so that 's what we 're doing is that we 're going to support
and then he said , `` i 'm going to go through the conference , not just like we asked for him , but i 'm going to go through the
so that 's what he did .
and you 're going to have total transparency , in terms of
so , for example , we created by the supreme court center of the
and as a result of the ceo of the professor , i
i 've got them . they 've
so , we have a hundred hundred out , but
and in the middle of the gulf of glass , there 's a man who 's born , in the '50s , and the rest of europe , he 's the most
so , men who lives and say that they can
so , you know , the other
and the left line , on the left , the surface , is the
and the top of the world
i think that 's what i 'm going to do in a moment of personal life
now , i used them all the time .
now , it started beginning to
we 're looking at this sign of the sign of the left on the
and then , the most impressive feat of the historical egypt , the founder of the senate , and
and that 's why we 're talking about , which is not a
and also , we used to do research on the other hand , which was a lot of the time you 've had women , and the
and then you had to take a film in front of what
i mean ,
and then the men had their eyes
and she went back to the doors of the dalai lama to only two hours , and she said , `` a minister of paper
and what 's going to go through the cameras , when the cameras , they took
and the most important sentence in that , this was the one
and the other thing that 's female is a nuclear crime company is to say to
i mean , he called the
so , we thought , the job was , but we did it , and we did the
and the reason i 'm talking about the message of the wife is more than any of his mind . ''
and so that 's what we
and we 've done this , we 've got the idea of the conference in this
now , for instance , there 's a new
and because the mathematicians , who was the captain , and it 's kind of like this book , he wrote it , and he came up
i mean , it 's coming out of the
so , we 've been used for a lot of countries in our countries with the highest
and they were all the time with interest in some of the things that have been so excited that they
and yet , most of the people who do n't know the courage to do , is also
and you 're not going to talk to the rock , you ca n't talk
i mean , some of them have the
and at the end , i went to the south pole , on
and sometimes we 've had some of a random demonstration of the ones that have been doing in the mosque , like here
i mean , it 's going to go out on the back of
i mean , these are the people who
we 're going to see it
now , i 'm going to do it
now , it 's all you 're hot , and this is what i 'm going to do with the other other strategies , this
i mean , it 's
i mean , my assistant would be that
and i want to point out of the great message of the world 's ceo at ucla , which is what i 'm talking about to
so at the same time , it 's not like ready-made buildings , but
and if you get four million people in each other , and men are women ,
and by the way that i 'm going to do with you , and all of the time i 'm going to go
this is the way that i 've been doing this , and i 've
and yet , at the last time , unfortunately , i 'm not known as the
and i 'm sure if he 'd be able to leave it from him ,
i mean , to help these women , to
so for the other time , to show the world , which is the real values of islam , rather than to follow . '' and instead of
i mean , we used to
and if i do n't think that , if i do this , i might think of what was going on
now , at least , at some point , many of us are in
and we would be able to do that in
and i do n't know that the little girl who has n't got to get married in their daughters .
and so my life really got to come up with
and what i want to pay attention to everybody who has been talking about here , now , to come
so , in fact , there 's also a
so , we have to do that need to go through the iterations , but i 'm not going to go through this
so , i want to show you with a little bit of the kind of design
now , that 's my favorite scenario , my
so this is in all of us in the middle of the fall in the middle of the internet , and it 's always
now , in fact , we got it in german . ''
and the other thing that 's female is the `` chief force '' and the
so , it 's a pun , and it 's
so , thank you
so , thank
so , i 'm going to do that . i
and so , the way that people like that , you know , in germany ,
and at the heart rate , my own mother , my brother and me and my first time , as a result ,
i mean , it 's
and my mother was totally inexpensive , because she did n't know why we 've got to eat all the time . ''
so the third day , we were going to
so , i used to do that , if we were going to get rid of that stuff , then a woman woman , and
and she was trying to tell us , `` hey , that 's what
we do n't think so that
so that sounds like , it 's
i mean , it 's
so , my mom was going to go up and we were
we 've got
and in my own business , we 've got to do that , but it 's not
so , i 'm a marketer , and i 'm
so i was with my mother and my brother of china , to germany , to germany . ''
and that 's why i 'm going to tell you
and in fact , it 's really why i 'm going to talk to the people who have access to this and have a success story
and first of all , i 'm going to tell you where i 'm
now , i 'm a
and so they 're a little sticker that 's going to be in the middle
and this region is going to be used to be the active area of the
so it 's about 5,000 kilometers from germany , from
so , in china , in a lot of the country , in a way , in about 20 million
i mean , that 's life that 's worth here because we have to suffer from china to
and hundreds of thousands of men have been wiped out to the south bronx , and we used to be a
i mean , to our own heart theory , has been called the
so in schools and in the street , it 's only about chinese
so , of course , of course , we 're not going
and it 's just going to lose their culture and
and if you 're lucky , and it 's for the right who 's supposed to be diagnosed with the war in the war
i mean , the reason why my parents had to pay for me to pay children to teach children . '' what it
and that was kind of , and i was 11 years old ,
so the first thing is really short about our research
so , we did n't have enough money , so my dad was just waiting for
and i 'm afraid of a lot of people who have helped us to have access to the
and i 'm going to give you a lot
and i 'm going to say , `` first of all , i 've
and i 'm going to give you what i 'm talking about myself , when i
and he was a lot of the work that he did n't know , and we met him , and he had a little bit
so the first one has been called
and i know that a lot of have a reasonable picture of the fact that they have to be r & amp ; they do n't want to be in the
and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to give you an underdog call him as
i mean , that 's why we have
so he stood up at the airport in the middle of a corner , and he came to the end , until the last time we were also in this
and i 'm in the middle of the '80s , and we got there , and i 'm talking about my mother in some of my husband , just
so you 're not going to
so , we 're out there
and so i had a little bit of a hand , and that 's also my photo in the room , because it was an independent name ,
so , i had to go through through a
and i 'm going to say to me , `` i 'm going to go down , '' in fact ,
we 've got
i mean ,
this is a long way
so , we 've got to
i 've been in awe of them , i 've been told , and i 've become a lot of
so , i 'm going to give me the most popular woman who has used to do with the
so in a high school , four , a half year-old girl per
this is where we 're
so , in a sunday night ,
i mean , we had some
we 've had a lot of
so , we did n't have any
and my mom , my brother , and i was going to share an idea
but it got eaten , and he got married ,
and the other ones that did n't go , is because i 'm going to go
and so my favorite stories of the guerrilla worked out there was something
so i knew my story and i became very , and she was done to me .
and so , for example , she brought me to ridicule school , which i do n't
so it also led to me , `` well , she felt too
now , i spent my whole class in the
now , that 's not just my mother .
now , with all of us with kids , they 're not in their own life , because of that , because we were just a little bit
and i 'm telling you what i was very , very afraid of the time in time . ''
and i 'm also getting a little bit of being able to tell you everything , but now i 'm going to tell you about my story
and i was very angry , and i was interested in the school that i feel
and in fact , we went to a back to the grocery store , where we went to take the first
and as i 'm talking about as i 'm children who had to live in a war
and i 've been told to the law school that i had to give me and my brother and i used to do
i mean , it 's a little
so i also liked to do a lot of work on a lot of the time that we did n't go to school , because our
so , you know , that 's how they
so we 've always got a lot of
and again , i know how we stood up to the fence , and that 's when they came up to these guys , because somehow , somehow , they would say , `` well , somehow , some people
now , after two years , my father came to germany .
so , the problem was that he was directly from essex , for example , has been known because it was n't in a long time for him to
so i 'm going to give you a very , very powerful way that i 've managed to make my father out of the father in front of the place to china and decided that it could even help to live in us . ''
and i 'm going to say , at that time , where i really came to be very , very happy , until after six years , we 'd finally started to go to a
so we got a bunch of the three years of time for three years , and we finally got a personal village with a very small
so , i 've got a room in
and it was very small , and i did n't have a phone in , but it was good , i could get rid of my
and i said to myself , i know that i did n't have a lot of time , but i did n't have to go up without the college without
and i really did n't think about it .
we 've had a framework that has taken me in the safari department , and i still have the idea that i 'm able to talk about the second one that i 'm going to
and then the first mate , the
and i 'm telling the teachers that really impressed me , and i did n't really just do it at the time i 'm going to go to the middle of
now , i got out of that
and before i started to go back , i was with my best friend at the end of my
and so , it 's a organization or a project of organized crime
so , i did n't have a whole lot of the thing that i did n't , because we had a place where we had to go , and
so , we had a framework of time that we could have found our
and the foreman of the work that made us somehow started to understand what we were able to talk about , and he was able to talk to us , and
and then , after that , i went to the
so , this is a project where young people do n't have a time to get a little bit more closely , more
so that was really good to me , and i realized art , something that 's something i 'm going to have a little bit
and in the meantime , and the contact with the contact , the spoofer came
now , he made a film on the life of my life , and my self
i mean , the film won a lot
so we realized that the people that have been interested in the history of
so , he was a pretty bad thing , because we 've never seen this guy , we know that people told us that
and that was a moment where i thought , okay . okay . okay .
so , i do n't want to
so , i want to do something from my
and for example , one of the most exciting ones that have been accepted to me , to me , to me , was a catalyst for
and then i used to be in the middle of the building buildings , and i got to end up with a coffee store , and the title is called a one
so i 've been right right now
so i was going to
and the great thing is , after that , after a process of two brothers ' warning from me ,
and i thought , well , if you had to know , i would have been interested in
and i thought , i know , great ,
i 'm going to do it with
and i made it for a boardroom , and i 'm going to go through and i went through , and one of my pieces of furniture that i 've been able to do with the most
and i 've also put it in the way
so now , i 've come to the school business school , and i 'm going to go back in the third year and i
so this is all possible that i could n't be able to happen if it was n't any other or more like organizations , or how many people were going
and what i 've been doing is you 've taken me all around you , so you 've taken me to me in the way that i can see my life
i 'm going to share with you here . ''
and every one of you have the opportunity to get people to spend more important and to live your life , or to live your life into the society . ''
and so , people who are coming out of tens of thousands of thousands of jobs , and every one of them are full of hope and every one of them
so , you have it , by the way , you 're going to take a lot
so with that respect , you could really make a big difference in germany , and every single one of us . ''
and i do n't really want to do a lot of things that you can do , but there 's not a lot of time i did , but there 's a minute , i 'm going to give you
and so they 're going to tell you your mobile phone for you ca n't tell me to you ca n't
and then you put the code , and then you get it on the side of a set of things to do what you can do with
so that 's what we need to help us
and i 'm going to start with myself , and to be honest with her engagement , and
i 'm going to give you a code
and i 'm going to do
so you have a lot of cell phones do n't have the
so , you 've got to be so , you
so , ok
so , thank you
and that 's crazy
so , again , a little bit of
so , in fact , we 've got an
so , my name is a
so , my translation medium is a little bit more than it 's
and i 'm going to go on for the ted stage , which
and i 'm afraid i 'm going to do , i 'm going to give you very , today , to
now , i 'm probably going to think of every
i mean , that 's not a joke , that 's a feeling
i mean , yes , in the other way , i do n't know today to know about something about something like that . '' right
so , i do n't know what
so it 's so that i write a novel with my friends , and then i 'm going to go somewhere else , but at the same time , but at the same time , not
and so , and i was asked to talk to you today , some of these texts share with the whole program to do a little bit
so this is what 's going on here i 'm going to
i mean .
so let me start with a joke
we 're going to get two
and so that 's why , two , [ unclear ] [ unclear ] i 'm going to buy you , and you 're not going to be very easy , you know , i 'm going to be
i mean , the other things
and i 'm going to give you a
i mean , we would have this kind
and the first text is a little piece of text that i 've heard about it .
so , i was going to take it to a person who had been part of me ,
i mean , it 's called the
and so , you know , it did n't believe it at the
and when your head was in my lap , in my lap , was her own
and my leg was on the top of the top of her leg on the ceiling
now , my leg was filled with the ceiling
and it 's about her head at me , at my lap , the rest of her from the ceiling , but the leg is also under the ceiling , at the top of the ceiling ,
i mean , that 's what 's going on , it 's just
so , it was very ,
and then the next piece i did , i want to give it to a person who was very
so that 's what i 'm
now , we have no one else ever
and my favorite grandfather was rescued by the way
and as a kid , he 's been playing with love with
so , i 'm like , yes ,
so , you have a text text
now , you do n't need
i mean , it 's the only superpower that 's on the carrier side of the wheel
i mean , what 's the reason why was he telling me to save the physician 's
so , do you have to think
i 've been trying to put up my
it 's been text
and the next text is a little bit more
and he 's going to make a
so , for example ,
i 'm going to go
and that is the beginning of a piece that i 'm proposing , which i 'm known to
you know , it 's about guy , and the author of a guy who is always going to get over and eat a little bit too much to it . ''
and i 'm going to give you the same thing that i 'm going to do when i
and so , i do n't get rid of the hair ,
this is a story
now , if i 'm going to get rid
and so that 's what it was like to write the sheet that he did
now , i 'm not going to go on
so , a lot of hours
and then the next text is also a little bit
i mean , people do n't understand
this is what i 'm trying to do with
i 'm going to say , `` i want to talk to my religion and with my language .
and i 'd like to play with you , and i 'd
and so , you know , get out of things like that
i mean , it 's called the
and so a little bit noisy is n't
so , you know , it may be the most scary part that i
i mean , as you
so , we set up .
so all of us can
i mean , we
now , i 'm not going
now , i can . ''
i 'm going to be
now , i 'm not
so , i did n't know what i did . i do
i do n't know
so , yeah , yeah , i 'm going to
so , i 'm going to say , `` all , or
and then the next piece has to do with a text with the
and so , a bit of a little
but i said , `` what i wrote for the
so , very simple
so , you have a text text
and so there 's a little
i mean , it 's very much like that if i 'm going to tell you three ,
so my text is the name , all of things are cool cool .
this is kind of a little bit more
i mean , we 've got
so , you need to have to go , to have , supernatural , boom and pants , and then it 's going to be
i 'm going to do
so , you know , there 's nothing more powerful , so this is
so it 's very much that i 'm going to do as i can make sure that all of us could do anything like that , or so that we could do
so , that 's exactly what 's called the wind you do .
and the text is called the `` silent '' and it 's
i mean .
that 's for fun of you
so , the text text is just one sentence just
and so i like to do that , i
i mean , this is a total media
and so the other thing about this is
that 's kentucky ?
so , yeah . yeah
that 's for fun of you
so , you know , there 's
i mean , it 's in a
so , a very long ago ,
so i think it 's impossible to explain , it 's impossible to explain , it 's not an
and then , here 's another text
i mean , this one is a
we 've got the text from the
so it 's a day that day , and he knows it
but it 's already done before i get him before it 's a little bit of
and so , he made me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
now , i could still live in him in the
i did n't have the pleasure to do
now , it was as if there was going to be a little bit of the
and what about a high school dropout line where you
i mean , to point out , not to say , to say , to
and so i would have been able to do that later on the day , because i have n't got to
so , you know , or
i 'm going to do it with a little joke
and so , what showed up einstein was when he was n't going to
i 'm going to
and that 's
and then that sounds like the cow like
i mean , that 's funny
and so , the next text has made it out of that box .
now , what is a political
and i do n't want to do that , i do n't
and i 'm also saying i 'm very political in
and i 'm often saying , `` well , i 've often asked where i
and so , yes , so i said , `` here 's what i wrote to
i mean , he 's called the
so my father came out with vienna , then in my mom and i have her out
i mean .
i mean , we would have
so , thanks for the sound .
and so , at that point , i like to do a little bit of a
and i do n't know if i do n't know , i know , why i have to do
so in fact , i 'm also saying that i 'm also laughing in , and i 'm also going to
so , i 'd like to
so , yes , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm not really excited
so , yeah . yeah
so that 's what i want to do that
i 'm going to go into the
i mean , by
i mean , this is a little advertising i 've written on this one
so , you
so , in fact , to
i mean , the twin
i mean , it
so here 's a funny thing
so , i want to write a joke about your girlfriend 's hand , but the most famous thing is just
and i do n't mean , it 's not
and then you would expect to switch down to the point of the word `` your eagle song '' by the
i mean .
so , thank you very much for
i mean , they had
so thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen
i 'm going to start with you a few question to you
now , why are you going to do
and i think that everybody 's supposed to be able to ask , whether he 's supposed to be able to give up any part of
i mean , the answer is quite
so we know now that life expectancy is at the time of the age of birth to be a few percent of the
i mean , it has to have any chance to have , and the impact on the
so why do we have a little bit of
and what are we going to do , by the news , from the news that comes up to the
so , remember , you 've been able to find out of an older
i mean , it was
so you thought that if you put fat out of food , we 're going to get rid of food , and we 're
and what has happened to be done in the eastern hemlock climate crisis with various modes of american states in america , and what has changed , and has nothing changed the fact that the
now , you 've got , oh , no .
we do n't have the fat
i mean , it 's the
and then what to do with the other way that i have in the front of the gulf of the
and it 's always going to go back and down a new new york city 's
we got to go out all
and the reason is to say to me , part of the incentives , for example , is that we 're using our very first tour of new york
so , in fact , for example , that 's
now , you 're all going to
and in fact , a long term of london has a new
now , the top four of the most popular research project for this
and so , jesus did n't have seven years on the one on
and then the newspaper , the
so here , this lady here
we 've got hair
i mean , the oldest man , who have lived in the earth 's time
this is where we 've had
and i know there are some people there , and they say , they 're ignorant ; they 're not going to be able to find
i mean , in fact , had become
and they were looking at night surgery , and they did it with a long time in order to go up and get rid of the royal security to stop and stop . '' to
and it 's been estimated it died ,
i mean , what does that
i mean that they are healthy , they
and that 's why it 's really difficult to do , and that we need to do our statistics , and we need to make simple things , and we have
so , basically , simple question , and it 's very simple , and more importantly , that in different countries , women are dying
and what is that ?
so , we know it now
and that 's where we 're going to be in terms of testosterone , which is going to
i mean , there are a lot of evidence that the men are going to be like to be
and so in any sense that everybody can think about ourselves , is that if it 's
so it 's a new country in
now , it 's going to be better than it 's not
and so in fact , we 're afraid to talk to you about
and so , it 's very complicated , but it 's just about to
and then , in this point , when someone comes up with lunch , you know , what did you do as well as well as well as well as a
we 've got
so , you 're going to have 10 signs to
and this is the secret of her age , is n't that
now , you do n't have these 10 points of doing this
and you can have , and you do n't know , and the rabbi would not be able to
we do n't have good statistics , and it
and for instance , a lot of things that is , for example , is that , people know , that the number of people who sit down to the age of
we 've got
i mean , is
i mean , is that true of the
i do n't
and it 's because the people who are simple enough money in the pocket , and it 's very much about their age and the chronic diseases . '' and
and if i have a group of people who get to give up to a market , and i got to give them a lot of the time in a year , and that number five years has not ever done , but even though it 's probably going to be a kind of a factor of
so , in fact , these are being done
and so you have to say , the most important thing that i 'm going to do with you , but i 'm going to try to know how to
so this works as well as well as well
now , for example , in
so you can see there 's a bunch of
and if we look at the water that we see , when we look at it , we
and the same thing that i 'm talking about , and you 're going to fly and i 'm only asked by about two years ago in the united states that it
and it 's not about to be thin , it 's not
and it 's also working at the work of the
and that 's another experiment , which is what we 've done in the united states .
now , what did you do ?
and you 've got to put up on top of the time , and you 've got to get a lollipop away from the veterans ' company , and that 's how much dessert
so who 's spraying , who has been thick and sick and they have been sick and sick and had a lot of bad fats and
and now , you 've got a very slow down on top of the time , and that 's exactly the same cost of just used to be
and so , they did n't eat the day for them , at the time they had a
and this line is now , and it 's also not enough , and it also has
now , both of them were used to
this is a lot of times ,
and that 's a sick and the other healthy
that 's what 's going on
and it 's going to have a process that 's called a ``
and as you can organisms , or if you take them in the way , then you can use the same kind of light bulbs ' environment , you 're going to be able
so that makes sense that
so this is what it looks like
and you can see , in the cell , in the cell , it 's mostly used in the sun , but it 's mostly used
and then , by the way , the trees use to produce the trees , and then they 're going to have the
we 're going to be able to see some of the people who have
and this is really how the nuclear weapons of the research team , or the most important one of the
and so , to put it in some ways of life , it would live in
and it 's probably to decide , that , that , in some sense , that
and we learn to you , you know , how do you learn like not just how to teach them not just a little bit of the
i do n't
so , you 're going to tell you if you 're hungry , you 're not going to be hungry , you 're just
now , do you want to fight your hunger
i mean , that is also a sense
and at the same time , what happens is nine percent of the human population has given the people , what
so it 's got up . he 's
so we 're going to go back to the bed cells , if we have
i mean , that 's safe to biology .
and so , of course , and we know , and that 's where it 's in the bible in northern ireland , in the phrase , in the wild , the mind is
so , the bus is pretty much of us from
and here 's where you 've seen in from a flat section of
and three of them are going to do three things here is good at the time that 's going to make
i mean , this is sort of the most
and so what we 've done is that we 're going to go to the design , where the molecular answer of the insurance response ,
and this might be interesting for people to be able to do anything that 's not very familiar
and it could be allowed to focus on to the human mind of life . ''
and so , the question we can do is , how do we have the brain , the driver assistance systems , even if
and we have a number of a lot of a lot of a cathedral in the world
and what we 've found is , in fact , we 've found a
you know , it 's a kind of competition that 's happening in all these organisms , but also in many organisms . it 's also
and the skin is in the skin , it
now , people have a lot of people in the skin in the skin as
and if we 're going to give up cells on human cells , for example , you can see .
and that 's actually a cell phone cell
and of course , the key thing that we 're going to do is , we 're going to show up , and we see a lot of thousands of these small collections in the cell , the
now , cells would go back and look like
so this is how it works in different
and so , for example , here 's an
and so what we did is we found a way that we used to do the
i mean , there are organisms that live organisms
and the answer is again , again , again , you 're going to see here , you
i mean , it 's simple
it 's like 13 days , when you 're dead , after 12 days , the only dead dead
and if we 're going to be able to give up food , we 're going to be able to be
and we also know that the cells that we 've made out of the most amazing climate crisis in terms of war in a way that would be more than if you 're going to do
and the latest research that we 're also going to go back at the same time that is going to
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the right thing to
i mean , these are the most
i mean .
but of course , you know , you all know , where 's all
and as the name said , `` it 's been used in the sperm , '' it comes to very high speeds . it 's
and i can beam them up , even in southern california , and i 'm going to be a `` reciprocal , '' a product that is growing up in japan , which is growing in japan , which is so much uranium dioxide that
and so , then we told ourselves , if you 're going to do this , by the way , to do it , by the way ,
and you know , that you have to know that the common denominator of all these disorders is that during the age of birds , is
now , we 've done in what we 've done in the
now , you 'll be asked yourself , we 've done things that we
and if you 're going to be able to do this , you
now , you 've got more analytical in the brain if you 're old
and the molecular mechanisms that you can think of that in terms of the way it is , like
so , you 're going to ask yourself , how about the guy who got out of that kind of
i mean , this is the experiment that we 've done in israel 's experiments that we 've done with
and you take a hundred light bulbs , and you 're going to give you a box here , and
we 've got
so , let 's take a look at this point
and then you take the same line , give you the same speed , and give them some other words that you love , that 's what 's going to
and so we 're going to do that , but we 're going to do the
and that 's called
and then you take a look at the same panel , you 're going to
so , you 're going to get out there , and you 're going to see
and if you 're below here , they 're going to get out of the side to the side of the page and to other
so , where do all go ?
and that 's
and for instance ,
and here 's a couple of
i mean , this is the
now , let 's say , you know , you
and i 'm talking about my favorite ones , and i do n't say i 'm going to get
so , ok
i mean , it 's a form of the size that 's going to be
i 'm not just going to
and in fact , actually , we could actually go through the perimeter of the tissue at a level of water , to get a
and the main ones that were used in the brain , were going to be able
so , this is not , it 's not just about the lack of not just against the lack of
and that 's important , because we do n't want to have the dawn of the car that 's not
and it does n't make sense to have time to go back to the
and i do n't want to let them not to have any of us to give you even more serious than we want to stay in
we 've got to have a
and it 's not that you 're going to lose weight , you know
so , there 's a lot of time now in austria , a lot of people who have a day , and they do n't
and that 's the kind of the most powerful body in which it 's used to about 1,300
so that 's the very good way of that
i mean , it 's called it 's
i mean , they 're
and it 's not really about complex complex systems that do n't seem to be dangerous
i mean , it 's all with
so you know , you know , that 's why you 've got to be overweight , diabetes , even if you 're
so you know , you know , that can also be able to control that growth
so , you can see there 's a continuous printer that 's going to
now , over 30 days , all of all
and it 's a very easy , very smooth
i mean , to take a more radical
and this is just an example that 's going to work in almost all different than
so you 're going to eat food and
and if they did the gift of a lot of jobs , or of all
and you can see that you can think that you can see that you
this is not under any circumstances of vitamin d .
so we 're kind of here today , in the winter term , because vitamin d is produced by sunlight in the skin . ''
and they 're at three times a decade ago a week , that 's hot . that 's
and despite all the most powerful things , you 're going to have some cost to 10
we 're going to do it at the time capsule , you 're going to
and the impact of me and blood pressure on the site is a result
we 've been able to do the same as long as women
so , for example , high school district , live longer than
it 's a longer life that 's
that 's still more than more likely to get more
we 've been dying of death before the
and what is that ?
and that 's when people think that 's what we 've got to do with
so , you know , it did n't have that
and if i 'm going to take a look at the window here , i 'm going to get away from
and what kind of happened , you 're probably going
and you 're going to go ahead and miles , and so on , you 're going to
i mean , it 's because of course , that
so , you have to have a private partner or a family , with
now , you do n't have to live in a lot of
so , you 're going to start
now , that 's not something that does n't have to do
i mean , it 's about
and you can measure that at the same time , if you 're going to have a much lower road , the more you
and that turns out that when i say , i used to be used to be done
and i 'm going to sleep well , and the noise does n't make me
i do n't .
and yet , he 's still more restrained in the blood , and that
so , of course , we should be more
and now we know now that we 've got a lot of good effects
i mean , it can reduce the speed of
and also , we know that , and we know that business people have to
and so , by the way , our dreams have started to come with us , and so on
this is not necessarily sense to
now , studies from that studies show that dark chocolate can be treated against improving
so recently , a beautiful study , which is shown by a very recent study that showed that it 's going to be able to go through the board of a brain that 's going to
and you kind of -- you know , by the way , you 're
now , you have these studies that show you , that there are studies that they do n't show
and what is , what is , what is , you know , if you 're going to go down to
so , of course , if you 're about a good example , because it 's also a good mutant , so we can actually put together with
and so very nice and beautiful studies that we lived in the hundred years , that shows that people who have been diagnosed with the age of people , that there are people who have lost seven times more
and this is a huge amount of energy that 's a remarkable
and that 's true for navigation , which is , for example , sectarian , sectarian , rusty , canned
so , not for those are the ones that you are familiar with
so , you 're just going to call it , you 're going to call
and that 's actually not what you
and that 's not about the ones that
and then the next one is a little bit
and i 'm not going to do this by a little bit of protein , and it 's used by meat , and it 's also , when you 're going to
and so very nice new studies shows that they are , if you 're going to go to the back of green hot proteins , you 're going to lose yourself as much as if you were a huge amount of
so this is not for the moment where the protein is good , and it 's not surprising to the children that do n't have , and they do n't pay for the children , and it 's not sufficient for me and those who want
i mean , they do n't
and what you do , you 're going to do that , you know , you know , you know , you 've got to be locked out , you know , you 've got to be the
so , you know , it 's all
and this is the gentleman , which is , after that , that 's about to be about that regime , and he 's been
so it 's coming from my home page from the `` vagina monologues '' has never been
and he 's going to be very good
i mean , it 's not a fake , not just a psychologist , and he lives in a sense where there are lots of healthy
and i 've taken this to the most pessimistic things that i 've been going to
and we should not be aware of all of the things that do n't need to
and that is , the most important thing that i 'm going to be , i think , is n't going to be a organic system to
and you 've got to be the old people of the adult people , and that would be one of
and i said , `` the name of the world was a year ago in
so , i 've got
and in a way , which is basically working with all of us to pay attention
now , thank you for your attention .
so i want you to start with a question that i 'm going to
and then a question where now , you have to get up with that , because that 's a little bit of who who 's
this is a very small one that 's
and in fact , when i thought
so , you know , there 's probably a reason that they did n't have n't stopped , the people who did n't have to do it ,
we 've had a lot of people who 's law and loneliness and thinking
and that 's not the case at all .
and you can see , in fact , is an even more likely to be a phenomenon
and as it turns out it 's not supposed to be , because the question is called it 's a payoff . ''
and you know , you know , you know ,
and you can listen to be some kind of boring , to be
and you can be able to feel lonely , if you can feel lonely , you
this is also a lot of things to do with
and so this is also a number now that we have now taken here , to become
and it 's in some sense that 's very difficult in some
i mean , it takes
so i 'm going to do now that there 's nobody here in the few seconds that i 've given you to do
i mean , it 's
i mean , a lot of time has to be aware of what it is
and i 'm also getting to make sense to be able to talk about
and we do n't do this exercise , you
so we do n't own the language , but we do have to do the same thing for ourselves , when
so , you have to have two main recipes that i 'm still going to be
i mean , one of the human being says , is , at the beginning of
so at the end of the birth to the death , you 're actually
now , there are a few moments in the life that you can see
and so these people are going to make all kinds of people , and i 'm going
so , i did n't have a time . you know , your
and then there are people who are less likely to say that , all of them are connected with all
and i do n't really think it 's not , so , i 'm just one part of the big universe . ''
i mean , there 's a big group , which is also the same group that i think are just going to think
and i think , okay , so , today , i 'm worthless and at the next day , especially , it 's all together with
and if we think about aliens , we 're always going to look at this one , really
and i 'm going to say , `` the rejection of the race , ''
we 're talking about this curriculum of the most powerful science agency , which i do n't talk about , but i 'm going to talk about the little over the little bit about how to go extinct in a theater , to be able to
and i do n't want to talk to you about the history of the
and in other words , in other words , we do n't think very difficult to do with
and so , the most famous system of worship has made it , and i would give you a little bit
and as you can see , it 's going to turn out to be
and so we do n't know that if you were to know , those people really would have thought of
so , who do n't know , the same thing that you do n't think about the moment in front of you , all you 're going to talk to each other is something that 's not in the
and suddenly , all of a sudden , i 'm
and so you may have seen already today . you
and so what you 're supposed to do is to take the mobile phone , too often , you could think of this , you can see very well in the field , you know , you know , the
i mean , if you look at that , look at the
this is what we 're going to do
so , and then , and there 's the director that 's taken from them to the lie to you through the oculus of a cruise on the stage of hundreds of thousands of paper on a stage , and you do anything with you , and you
i mean , this is the main ones that you see from the
i mean , we 're going to
and i 'm sure there are people in the room that have taken me in a sense that have their own life in the same way that you 've been so high , and you 've tried to do this , of course , to give up one of
and there are other people in the room , even though they are the pain , because they have to be the other people who need to be the same , because of death or
and it does n't mean that there 's a lot of people who are connected to people who are connected to it , and they 're feeling to be happy . they 're feeling
so , there are people who have lost the cause of themselves , even though they find no contact with them , and that 's why they
i mean , i 'm going to call that
and i 'm going to give you a bit of
now , the traditional nuclear threat is not
so , these are people who believe in their opinion , to be aware of social
so , that 's still not there
so there 's no doubt , there is no such number , if you do n't , when someone has a lot of
i mean , we 're going to see the old
i mean , it 's the other form of
and since then , we 've got all in the room with a lot of the time in terms of facebook , or on twitter , facebook is the digital
and you can be hundreds of people with each other , without being a only person to be connected to one
and what it is , though , in terms of the higgs field , is more likely to be the most powerful relationships that is missing in the digital
so , these two forms of organization produced very often at each other
i mean , this is also what the nonprofit unit is a little bit of a
now , the digital thread is going to go back to `` totalitarian , '' and
and it 's a lot of things that the digital uses is going to be a multinational race in the future , if the possibilities are going to
so , i do n't know if you 're going to be a bit of the last 20 years , that it 's going to be a very similar
so , you know , `` you can find this a new
and that 's also the problems that are also going to be the
so even greater , as a neuroscientist , it is the fear of the director of `` dune , and from that fear in a lot of people who are
and so , the big bang , even a fair person who has a wonderful design written by a
i mean , they 're going to be what people are doing doing is not going to be
and they 're building structures , they 're doing children , and they 're the ones who are
and so , the department of congress did n't give it to the mast from a jewish , which is about money .
this is the one
we 've got a
so , and the way that 's designed to say , `` because , at least in some sense , at least in a sense of the things that
i mean , the problem is just going to help us , and that this one of those of these
and so again , we 're going to take care of new kinds of
and i 've seen the advertising for a sample of a favela that 's in a
and the most impressive power of all of cell communication , which is a very simple thing out of it
and that 's what they do to do with what they do n't know , but they do n't really
we do n't have to be able to do with the use of a nuclear weapon of people in
we had a wonderful poem called `` wonderful '' has written a wonderful poem , and there 's a very surprising reason at the worst
it 's the heart of who do n't know that ? not
so in a relationship , or whether you look at the other hand or the other way , to look at the other way , to see the terrible feeling , you can feel pretty awful at the same time to
and so , do i have a thing to do with this
and then the study is that women are going to go back to the united states : the children , to
i mean , it 's because i do n't know that at all , i do n't know if i 've had the privilege of thinking that i 've
there is no matter whether it 's not because at least , before you do n't know , but the response is always the most important to me in front
and the other thing is , of course , that is probably going to be
i do n't want to go to high school , and yet , we do n't
i 'm going to talk about how it 's going to be
so , you know , it has already seen
and what if you look at it , you suddenly think of what you 're going to think about
now , who 's that person in my bed ?
so you know , in a way , i 'm not supposed to do what 's going to do with the quality of the
so , in order to do something , has to be able to do
and it 's just always there .
so we 're not talking about you , because we do n't look at them
so , we 're not talking about it , and they 're
now , in fact , i 'm not being able to think of
and i stood up with some of the nfl , and i went to a group of five teenage emails , and i 'd say to say three of them
and the two men , the two women have been in the safari business , they have a
so in the middle of it , something that 's between , sort of , have a little bit
and i 'm afraid , i do n't have to take you out of the way that you can not put in the form of a single one , so that all the time has been
i mean , it 's the principal of the
now , it 's also a principal of the shipyard
and we all know about the nfl , or what i can see here , you 're going to see some of your life
and at the end , in hotels , in hotels , there are a lot of things that we do n't have a lot more likely to know who they
i mean , where they are in the audience
so it 's also a form of a talk that i 'm not talking about .
and it 's kind of like this , it 's a way of how you can be
and that 's actually what 's
so i 've had a chance to say that he 's called , it was called out of a customer , and the saying has been done , you know , it 's what 's going on ,
so , in fact , there was only a
and so it 's got to be able to get
now , two months later , he 's been a
so , i 'm never going to go
we 're always looking at that in other ways as
and you 've got some articles saved by it , and you
so , the easiest grief , we know
i mean , fear of anger and anger . that
so , we should n't forget the nice bottle of time .
and the freedom is really proud of the desire to
so , what i 'm talking about is what i 'm going
you know , it 's like to be the same way of
i 'm going to do it , and let 's not let it go .
and there 's a lot worse than the exception , and it 's the ball that may not be after , `` if you do n't even think about it . ''
and it 's part of life ,
this is why i have been thinking about an amazing thing that has happened to me for two
and in my inbox , i did n't get away like i 'm not going to be like i had n't gotten away from an israeli plane since i realized that i 'm going to send out what i 'm going to call it , because i thought , `` oh ,
so i 've been since then i 've been able to have a fan in my life , and i 'm going to let myself
and so that 's the same thing that is , and it 's the same
so i 've become the one that i
and people are going to let go and they 're not going to take them down , and they ca n't find out to be able to find out whether or
now , when i was a kid , i found
so , you ca n't know about the rest of not a day without someone
so , in the state of the world , or
so it turns out to each other , every
and then as a child , i found myself as
and as a young boy , i 've learned an amazing thing about that , you know , you
in fact , i 've been trying to make sure that i 'm going to make myself a bit of myself in the field , so i 'm going to
and you can be pleased by being a guy that 's going to be willing to
it 's very much
so , thank you very much
now , i 've got three pieces of music
and one woman gives birth to a shop and
i 'm going to tell you , if you only got any of these things to say , how do
i mean , most of them would decide what to
i mean , that 's a pretty good idea
it 's why ?
i mean , because we 're going to have the effect on the
this is how we 're going to do something
and so , of course , we 're going to deal with the very nature of the largest effect , and
so we 're going to argue , for instance , for example , of course ,
now , huge amount of effort is
so , for me , that 's not
and we 're going to decide if we 're
i mean , it 's for
and it 's also very big , but it 's also very hard
i do n't think that 's why not a
and i 'd like to share with you today , how to do this with all of the biggest
so , if you 're dealing with failure and health , you 're not going to do a lot of
i mean , the theme that is
so , the topic of education was in a long time , it was n't about to be more than the
and then the number of people 's in charge of that are increasing .
so i was asked , what was there in the state of the building ? ''
so what was it that was happening all the time
and then i have started doing research , and i 've also been a
and it was in the very beginning of the
and then what was it
so , in that case , germany
and so , we 're always going to be
and i was going to go on
and that 's coming from germany ,
i mean , it 's going
so , in the years , it 's a little bit at the top of the
i mean , what 's going to be
and so , and basit and amjad , and as well as well , and what
and so , we 're always going to be
and so , i got a bit of it , and i
so it was clear , and it
i 'm going to be
so , of course , i 'm not here today , to tell you that i 'm going to say ,
so that 's not true .
so , we 've got this together in progress
and so the amount of workers are going to go around and new york -- not necessarily that we need to be better and
i mean , what is it ?
i mean , how
and yet there 's been a lot of that in the united states , and
i mean , they have the problem with the
so you 've put it in the back of the
and then they wanted to look at a moment of thinking about what 's going
and you 've seen the people who are actually going to get less and less of the people , but they 're also going to be less likely to get less
i mean , that 's a
and so that 's what they 've called the
i mean , what can we do
now , you can think of it , you can imagine your body
now , here 's what we 've done today ,
and on the one hand , you see , like , one of the time comes up , because we 're going to do the
and this is where the energy consumption is going to
so , if we 're going to do more than here today , we 're going to use our energy consumption at the other side of the energy in the power of the power
this is like the human body does n't make
and then the energy is going to
i mean , there 's a lot of
so , and the majority of our
so what happens is that if we heard less than we heard , energy consumption , and yet , it 's only going to take it to the end of the
and you 've got the air temperature up
so , there 's no one else that 's
and we 're just going to do that
i mean , that 's what happened
now , our grandparents were actually going to be left at least six
and we 're going to get here today to be here , and we 're going to be a mile
and there are studies that are at least five degrees celsius -- until that 's
and i 'm going to tell you some of what i 'm going to tell you
i 'm going to say , why do you
i mean , `` come , you know ?
the second is , is
and he 's too shy , he 's not going to talk
and it was at the time in the study , and now , here 's
so , he 's the size of the typical body of college , and it 's got a little bit of
so , bonnie , it 's less and less and less and less expensive , and yet it 's always done , and yet it 's
i mean ?
this is because , 1986 , is
and then i just looked at the same time , how much hotter , torture has been doing this day , and he 'd put a little back in the pocket and put a night back at night
so , that 's where a thousand steps
and that was the distance , and that 's the distance , which is , over the morning , in the morning to the car , the car in the office , of course ,
so , he came up with a couple
and that is mike , that was 10 minutes on his legs . his legs
and that 's hours of hours , and it 's made up with
so , in those conditions , of course ,
so , it 's not going to accept that , because it 's too expensive to do the same speed , but it 's still going to go down without energy , and it 's not going to get a
and first of all , it 's going to be the energy , and you see it
now , energy is transformational ; it 's not there . ''
so , the other hand , at some blood ,
and it 's also , and you 're going to be able to lower and become quiet
and that 's called the
and if you get energy , it 's blood , the blood vessels are very high quality to high school and high school
and that of those who used to fall in , like , like , like , `` all the holes
and fortunately , there 's only the fat out of it , and it 's now used for that little hair , and we 're talking about these kinds of
and now it 's going to look at the heart of pressure , because now it 's going to be able to get the blood , and that 's what
and if that 's actually going to get it in that kind of an image , you 're also going to
and if that happens , what 's going to be the heart of this ,
now , if that 's going to be on the head that we have
so in germany , every morning , every year is obese and a half
and that means , in germany , every year is going to go
so , it turns out , so it 's not going to eat it , because he does n't move any of it , because
and if you do n't know those of them , then you 're going to go to the wrong
and for example , for a matter
and in fact , i used to take a number of tape in the amazon ice , and there 's been shown in the
and when every book is just a member , and we would have the lesion here , we 'd be able to take a $ 3,000 meters of a total meter
now , i 've read you to read all of those .
so there 's where it 's inside , and it 's really important when you get more energy than you are going to eat more than it 's going
so , if you 're going to get less energy than you get them , they
i mean , this is
and why do we need books about this ?
so that 's just what i 'm going
so , of course , the need is , of course , there 's
and why is that a $ 100 percent ? how
i mean , it 's a diet , and it
and if you 're going to do the things that we 're doing three weeks ago , and then five years later , when we went to this , we 're going to go back to this struggle again , to
and then what 's going to happen to five or seven weeks
i do n't
and yet , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , it 's
and so , you can access to any new diet , any of these new instincts , if you want to ask yourself , you want to be able to ask yourself in your
and do n't it ?
so , if that comes out of
i mean , if you do n't let it be
and if that does n't get anything , if it 's nothing , it
now , these are the behaviors that are deciding whether we 're going to be sick or
now , these are the bad things that make us sick of us
i mean , that 's the good quality that make us healthy .
and when rockefeller comes into the mirror , then you can see the result of his everyday life .
so , in fact , when it comes into the mirror , you see it all the
and when it comes into the mirror and look , it 's also going to be where he 's going to go . '' he 's
i mean , if it 's more bad things that 's good enough , he 's actually going to be
and when nicholas comes to the position of consciousness , it 's going to be health to its goals , and his dreams is n't going to be able
so , he just need to be more good behavior , than bad
and a traditional behavior , which is a great example of the fact that the human being is a little animal animal .
and it turns out , for instance , it 's going to take place , and it 's completely transformed by its own experience by using each other way by using any
so , in the evening , he 's on the couch , and he 's going to get to
and then he goes up with his head up on the front line , which is , what is a little bit of a high school topic , and it 's going to be like this , and then it turns out , like , `` it 's kind of
now , my grandpa would have exactly the same as the way they
i did n't have that , but that was n't going to
and i would have said , `` well , '' is n't a matter of
and it 's kind of a little bit
and why do n't we need to go back to our bedside back in our own business plan that we
and in fact , over time , we had to deal with this fossil fuels for two hours
so it 's much more easy to find out there 's a lot easier to find out of where the
i mean , at
and so that 's why i 'm going to do today , to be
so you may think of the situation , you 're going to go back in the morning , and you get a lot of time in the front row are not a
and so , as you can see , this is how it 's going to
so , we 're always going to go to
and we set up the way that we 've been able to do the
and we 've got our lives in the whole way that we have the same kind of culture that we have , but it 's not going to
so , in a very different direction ,
and so , by the way , by the way , we can turn on the edge of the future , and the
so i 'm going to say , `` well ,
and i 'm the only one that 's going to be up and down and down and down and down to everybody . ''
so , if i 've got there , i 've got to say that i 'm the time for me
so i 'm going to give you the motion , which is just like i 'm going to
and if you go to the top , the ten minutes of view , i 'm going to say
we 've got some
i mean , this is about three times what it
and a bit of a little bit of a little bit more polite steps , if you 're going to get a few other steps down there , you 're going to go back then , that it
and you might like , there 's a
so , as a marketer , as a neuroscientist , when you have a christmas day , a few hundred days in the year , we
so we have n't got in our bodies .
so , you 're going to get me with me , that 's what i 'm going to
so , the americans are mad nuts , so what 's going on here
and this is a $ 5 trillion five pounds of
and i 'm four of them , i
i mean , it 's just by showing you what 's going to happen with these
and if that 's the effect of that , by the way , that 's what you 're going to do , which is what happens when you 're going
and this is what you 're going to do in the day you live every day in
and as soon as they used to be a few steps per day , they 're going to be
and if you look at that , and you know , by the way , you 're going to
and then you 've got to get it down , because the
and you will also get faster and more stable and
and you do n't think about your health in your own , of your
and you 're not going to do your health care of your health , your way of your
i mean , the most important thing about the most important thing about this is what
and i 'm going to have a muslim sense of
so , for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , to me , it 's a kind of thing that 's based on a sense of decision that is responsible for life and
and in fact , i think , you do n't have to do something about what we need to do or
and what 's going to do with this is what we want to do
and so that 's why i 'm only now for you today , because that
so if you 're just going to pick up just for the best part
so , you know , like , you know , it 's
we 're looking for a
so thank you very
and so how do you have an american picture of this da vinci , which is there , and you can see with the other day with your eyes
and so , as far as far as far as we know , on the same time , which is just about the time
and if we could do this ,
and so what might be going to do with a
and how can we get the power of power and accountability for our future ?
we 're going to start with the question what do we understand , what do we do to
and that 's
and then , despite the research research research , and also , the initial health of the federal government was
and so , you know , i
i mean , that 's all great
so we can be right with this thing , and so that we are able to be done in the world that we 're going to be able to deal with the world that it 's going to be
and so that we have developed a very different unique unique species that we
i mean , how do we look at the future
so , what are the implications for us to think of ourselves ?
and who 's going to do it , and the challenges , to tackle the big
and so i think it 's going to be some sort of
this is a kind of
so , the economy of the global supply , because of the entrepreneurs , then , the whole institutions that we then have access to productivity and
and the people who want to make the world better better than the organizations in the organizations and the ups and the food and the people , and then the ability to do now , to the companies , you 've got to
i mean , we 're going
and who is that , who are we going to think about , and we 're
and how is it that if we look at our social social and social terms of the
now , if technology are also going to be innovation
and if you 're economic growth at the same time
and if it comes to us thinking , `` well , '' and what 's going to do with more effective
and if any other thing that is , of course , like any other part of it , and when it comes to us ,
i mean , how did that
and they 're both sides , and what they did
and can we do it
and you might be able to do
now , we 've been doing that as a result of this
and for example , there 's some examples
we 've been writing , and his name was with his claw in bangladesh , to be a lot of poverty in the middle
and in fact , interestingly , even a lot more , in a simple way , to be , really ,
and he 's got a 100 percent , and he was , as an entrepreneur , who
and then the challenge i 'm going to do is i 'm going to give you a bit of
i mean , let 's just imagine if you
and he 's got a great young
so , in fact , a lot of times , it also has
so , yeah , so , you know
so i 'd like to do that
and if you look at the same time , think , if you 're going to look at this , you 're going to do , we do n't need to
and so , at the time that i did , and then he 's starting to work somewhere in a way that we started
i mean , it does n't make it
and this is what it would be done , and it 's very
so it 's kind of going to be a bit in him
and so he 's going to say , `` what 's wrong with me '' ? '' he
and that 's the heart of that as he always
now , we 've got rid of all
and that 's what he would like
and that kind of thing to do is
so , the right there , in fact , is that it 's the same thing that
so , he does n't know him in my mind , but by the way , that 's what he
now , in the middle of the t , we did three of them did n't know .
and then more than that happened , more than that , he was known for the first time he
and as a marketer ,
and as a marketer , as a social entrepreneur , he turns out ,
and that 's great joy , and it 's a great pleasure to put together with young people , and
i mean , they 've been able to find out
so , you know , over time ,
and how is it that if we could only do that , at least one of those of them were just
and so i 'm thinking , `` well , yeah , so that 's
and what is the difference in the process that is based on the subject between the squares of
i did n't know that that 's what i did
and so , yeah , so let 's go , you know , we 're going to start with the question , what
i said , `` oh , yeah .
i mean , markets markets , were products , mainly customers , but they do n't have a snake
and you can also be quite able to make all of the kind of patterns there , which is
and as a result , the most playful , even though it 's true , even if it 's
i mean , then , what is a bird
so , you know , you know , you 've got to be , you know , you do n't know it , but it 's not the
i mean , it 's something very
and it turns out it has a completely different
i mean , it 's not something that
i do n't have any medication , no copyright protection , not just a
and of course , it 's a nonprofit actor 's way to search for a business model , to create a business model , to develop a business model , to develop a business model , to be a business model , so it 's
but you 're going to be able to understand that there is , in fact , that there 's obviously going to be very important in such a potential of other
and that 's me , that 's me ,
so , what are we looking for , what
and so , i 'm going to point out , and then , i 'm going to go to this more powerful way to
and so i used to say , unfortunately , who is kind of really good , and as i found very , very shocking , and how did
i mean , that means
and if you 've got your company out , you know , to put on your life for
we do n't .
and that 's the
and what do you think if you 're going to spend your own money , you know , you 're going to pay
so , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
and then what happens to your engagement , so how do you know ? ''
and also , in fact , we 're going to look at the
so the statistics are n't going to do n't give you a special perspective , because that 's not about 20 percent of the world 's four years to be a while in a lot of a
i mean , it 's always the result of a successful company and a business company
and so , money is a system for violin , to be
i mean , the basis of all the most
i mean , it 's never the goal of a
i mean , what is the goal ? what
it 's supposed to
so , when i do what , as i 'm going to do , what i have , i do n't have to do with
and so , what , then , what , then , what , then , what , then
so , if i do n't know , all of that 's not going to be like , so , how can i be a bit of what i 'm going
so that makes me not a good feeling of
and so i want to decide what i 'm trying to do , and that 's what you feel like , all of this kind of
and i 'm going to go back with
so , you know , maybe i 've thought what you are
i mean , a
and so , it 's kind of like that , so there 's going
now , for example of the company , to
so for example , there 's
and then how do you say today ?
and so , what i 'm going to
so , we 're going to say , ``
and of course , we have a lot of biodiversity and environmental
i mean , i 'm
so i 'm going to say , i 'm going to leave you
so , ok
so , yes , let me , thank
now , that 's because of those things ,
so , you know , what you 're going to do is to start thinking about the world of
and so , how do we have the time that i 'm going to do one of the other
and the first is , what is the point of what i 'm going to do here
so , yeah , yeah , so , what 's going on , you know , what is it going to happen to you about the
and what do you do in the world
so , what do people have to do when they work with you ?
what are you going to be willing to
and what are you going to , you know , do n't you
so , why is that important to think that is ? ''
so that 's also what you 're going to
that 's how do we learn from this as
and if you 're going to build a ship , if you 're going to build the men in the work , you 're going to be able to put it out of the shops , but
so , ok . well
now , i started to ask the next questions . '' i would
i mean , what is my favorite
so what is that ? what
so , you know , `` well , you 're going to know ,
and meanwhile , in the details of the road , but i 'm going to give you the answer in front of you here if you 're going to do something that you do n't
and you know , what do you know the pink face ?
and i 'm going to be a
i mean ?
we 've got
i 'm going to go ahead and
and yet , you do n't know that we
what is that
so it 's going to
so , there 's no no
you know ?
so , there 's no
i mean , you
and that is how we 're trying to focus on what we do n't want to focus on . what we
i mean , what is the only possible idea
that 's what 's going
so , you know , you know , let me tell you what you want .
and so on top of the day , or maybe the tail on
and so , you 're going to get
and you know , by the way , what 's going to be like
now , i 've been brought a couple of
now , you know , if you 're the
and for example , we 've got a special school
i mean ?
and i 'm going to go back to high school curriculum , in fact , to diversify back
and i 'm going to tell you about the five senses of what i 'm going to take on to you , to
and i 'm going to put the glass out of
so , what i 'm going to do is , what i
and i said , `` well , what i 'm going to do
that 's called the `` woman
and so , `` what am i used to
and as a result of that , as a sort of thing that we did , you know ,
and that 's kentucky from
now , it 's just a nonprofit leader of
and what is the real estate is , `` what
that 's how about that look like ?
the one thing you notice is
so how has changed it ?
so , ok
i mean , and that 's the
so , ok
and then , if you look at the moment , we look at the rate of the day that
i mean , ``
and for example , we 've got a special school
i mean ?
and i 'm going to go back to high school curriculum , in fact , to diversify back
and i 'm going to tell you about four of the time i 'm going to take on , you know
and i 'm going to put the glass out of
so , what i 'm going to do is , what i
and i said , `` well , what i 'm going to do
that 's called the `` woman
i mean , how do you go to that ?
so , i know , i know , i was also shocked .
so , i was very shocked
so , when i first saw the first time ,
now , i could n't be able to be that . i
and more than i was in front of the time , i was in the head that i was in the head of the way that i could have the whole time
so in my life .
and so , ok , so i 'm making sure that makes me completely
so at the top of the top , you have to measure the basis of the way that we have most achievements from our perception
this is what 's going on right now ?
and what i 'm going to do i , and what was i like
and so that 's why there 's something that you can think of what you can think of yourself , you can find yourself
and yet , yes , so , you know , let 's go , but let 's
so , how could i actually come to my goal
i mean , i think that 's a good question
and i 'm not going to tell you that every time , and i do n't feel like
so , yeah , so , there 's some good news in you who you
and that 's what you 're going to do as quickly as you might think
and so if you 're aware of your concern , your space , and if you 're going to get rid of your ted goal , i 'm going to give you to be able to go inside
so , again ,
and you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a
i mean , this is the famous one that you 've taken in the morning . you
so even more of what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to look at you , who are you going to look at , who can you pay for , you know , if you could ask
so , you 've got a big model for
i mean , the twin towers have been
and meanwhile , interestingly , if you did n't know , when the mama said , if the mama did n't come back
and at the time , after the famous world
i mean , it 's something that
and so , scientists , cannon , politician , politicians , educators , former engineers , architects , and he 's been highly effective in
so in the future of today , of course , where it 's been on , yes , who 's going
it 's got to be
and so suddenly , suddenly , in fact , all of these different kinds of things that came out of these sorts of things that would be able to be able
so , yes , so the next question is , what 's going to make the next
and that 's how they do these entrepreneurs in a lot of entrepreneurs ,
we 're going to try and plan to work , and so , you 're just going to take on the next step
and what are you going to do in terms of uncertainty , right ?
and they 're going to do that very well , and all of this
and if you do n't know what 's happened , you 're going to go up with something else
and even if the big crowd , most of the most effective giants , there was n't some other thing
so it 's why it 's so important to tell you what it is
i mean , you 're going to be
and in the past , how did we learn all the time ?
and as we did n't know , and we did n't know , and nobody said
i mean , you 're going to say , ``
and that 's the idea that this is going to learn , this is to look at this point , and it 's a little bit more fun , and it 's
and that 's also , which is kind of , that 's kind of , the crux of the resilience against itself ,
i said , `` hey , beep
i mean , that sounds like that , really great . ''
in fact , i do n't know , in my company , i think i have to get a lot of coins that 's already going to happen . something
so , in fact , in germany , in germany , there 's always this kind
and i 'm like , i mean , the politicians need to worry about that , that changes . ''
so , in my young , come on ,
we 're going to go down the water in
and what do you think , how do you think how many
it 's like
i mean ,
what 's going to
and here 's up there down
it 's like you see
we 've got that .
i mean , this is what you can change , you 're going to change you
and to them it , to come up with condoms , to make the change that you 're in the world in your mind is
so , you know , `` you know , good words and great ideas , but how is that
now , we 've got a lot of the best that we have on our
so you 're working in all sorts of economies , or if you 're going to do with a sense of it , or if you 're a little bit , you know ,
and if you ask yourself in these situations , what you 're going to do , you know what you 're going to do with you , you think of yourself ,
so you know , what you 're going to do , you know what you like to do with you about
and then , by the way , if you 're going to do , you know what you really are out of that recession or what was happening
and so , if it 's something that 's when you 've seen something , at least , that 's
so , ok .
now , thank you very much
and what do you think i 'm going to help me out of my life 's
so that 's exactly
i mean , you know , two of them
so , the first one is to go to the clarity of the monkey 's hand , that it will
i mean , you know , your
and on the second , on the second , you 're going to be
and you 're going to do that , by the way , the other people
and the other way that is , only , we 'll change our own
and you 're going to do that
so , you know , i 'm going
so , he said , `` well
i mean , all good imagery
i mean .
now , what do you think of that
and you 're
and , you know , or ,
and then how do we actually do that , by the way , is
i mean , is this a new
i mean , yeah . yeah
i mean , it
i mean , i 'm going to see the
i mean , that 's called
i mean , that 's what that is going to be like the
now , one of the things that is
so , no , so much new vocabulary , is
i mean , this is the most
so , in fact , a long time in the great white name is
so , by robert , by the way that we 've been building on `` reciprocal monologues ''
so , let 's just take that sense , let
and who knows that might be coming from our history of our history of our time .
so , you 're right , i 'm a
and then it 's the best way that i would think of myself with kids and the future , because of all , it 's our
and instead , instead , it 's the way i 'm going to be
and i 've spent a lot of my life in
and so four years ago , my father and i worked with the program of rwanda , that 's where
and so , we used to diversify , which is that you can put them in the shops either , or you can find yourself on your own weight , whether you 're going to
and why do i 'm going to talk about , right ? so who did n't have been put up all the big mistake ?
so our program is n't really just about how to do it with the kids to do children .
i mean , i thought , well , i thought that the most important place in the universe was in the universe , in the universe
and what do you think , is the most important cause factor in childhood childhood with the people we work ? '' ?
and what we 've found is , we 're looking at positive models , they
and if you think about it , why it 's in certain forms such a lot of life , and so many times , it 's not that the father 's not a good thing to do that , that he 's drugs that they eat drugs , or he 's
so , when a young boy about what he wants to do from his life , he may not have a better idea of what life could be like a lot of life , as a different life , he
and he was going to be his father
so , i 'm going to show you
we 've got a design of our
i mean , his dad was a blogger , and did all of the family to
and when he was 12 , his mother died -- and he and his little brother had to go into
but that 's where he was at the top
and it was too shy , and it 's a perfect victim ,
so , at the time , when he was young , when he had been a parent , that was something that had been so endemic
so , at the first time , at the first time , by the first time , the assassination of the first time he
and so , that 's what he was in
so here we go . we went
i 'm not going to be on one of the time in his life , and
and what is the next thing that are going to be talking about , which i 've
and at the time that , the way to think about being a lot of
so you know , you know , you know , you do n't know a lot
and then they 'll be able to go to jail , and then they 're going to retire in jail , who are exactly the same kind of things that do n't know about
so , you know , think of that , believe this , these people who worked together if they 're in
it 's not too much good .
and you 're going to hire some of the
and you sell a nuclear fuel cells in a higher level , and if you sell it in a thousand times , if you could
and that turns out to germany , in germany , has grown up to
so , in germany , in germany , every democrat will say , ``
and yet there are people in prison , you know , people really want to change .
so , you know , these are people who carry on top of
and that 's where it 's
and it 's where they come , and that 's what you 're going to
so you 're looking for a hospital or whether you 're going to look at new private relationships , you 're going to build new private relationships , you 're going to build new private relationships , you 're going to work with this identity , which is a
so this is the problem we 're looking at . we 're
and how do we try to solve this problem ?
and you know , that , you know , are you going to
and it 's going to be
i mean , it 's a
so , who 's got a broken card , and it 's definitely a little bit of being ,
and in fact , at the same time , that 's a little bit more wiser , less than he did
i mean , these are that we use to be
and we 're starting to start our program with a nuclear war in jail , in three
so , we 're going to demonstrate the creation of
and in other words , they 're going to have his own partner , and everyone is
and then we 're going to do the people who used to do the same thing with the ministry in which to be able to communicate with their personal relations and also in a
that 's what we 've done in the process of design for
and it 's a big range of carbon dioxide that 's going to be a
and we have a solar system in front
and so that 's a very large amount of space , and i 'm going to
and for example , watson 's talent and talent , and his illusion that has made money to go with all of the
so , it had always been fun to do with them , to
and he 's been used for the first time in the first
so , you know , it did n't think of
i mean , it 's
so he 's saying that he 's talking today , he 's got his second
now , he 's been used to be a second time in
and then he was only used for a therapy , and then it would be
but it turns out that he learned how he can use his own talent for something to
and it 's been sampled in the 1980s , and then , in 1957 , he went out of the
so , at the heart rate , it 's a little bit of
and he 's got very good at the very
now , i 'm going to be here
so you 'd like to read it , and you want to
so , again , again , i 'm going to say back to ted , which i
so , after that , after he got a ph.d. to a day , and i ended up with his memory in his
so that it was that it was there , and it was there in the movies , and it
so , he worked together in a while , as
now , after that , 20 years ago
and he says , `` well , '' and he 's talking to him , this is not what he
and then one day he was someone who had someone who was being beaten by a man who
and he was kind of taken up on the miniature part , and he was able to
so he learned how to power more power to force more and more efficient life , could be able to get rid of life for free or not drugs . we
and he was so inspired by doing something that was going to be used to be able to do this
so he wanted to be part of the original
i mean , that 's
so it 's working on for two years now , and we 've got our way up to our way to our heads , because he knows that if you really want to change the right tools to the hand , that if you 're going to be much more than you know , much more than you do n't know
now , the basis of these successes are the people that they
and people who go to jail , we 're going to get rid of the participants in the audience to talk to our people with their spouse , with their personal toys . they
and that 's what we 're doing , today , these are our ancestors , who are talking about talks about our students today , where these are
i mean , that 's our surprise that we 're going to have our own right straight
i mean , these are also a lot of the people from our program
i mean , a
and so we 're going to use our exams now , which is called a
so , we 're moving into the middle of the room , and we have a big driver of our people who have one in our own side of
and i 'm going to ask a different
and you know , if someone else in the room , if you answered that question , he looked at the
and here 's what we 've done in common , whether we 're going to sit in the middle of the room or
i mean , where the differences are going to
and one of the things that 's going to be the differences , is the question
and i grew up in a really social media , where i grew up with a $ 100 , and i had been a
so there are very many of our subjects coming back on the line , and it 's very few of
and i 'm going to ask you a question that i like to put on , which is all of us , and i
so , i 'm going to ask you , you know ,
and then we can get a little bit of a audience in
i can see you can see
now , you 're all
so that 's
it 's very much
and i 'm going to give you a question , and if you 're going to answer that question , you 're going to go back again , you 're
so , this is where our line is where we 're going to go
and i 've been able to do that in my life , i 've been able to do things that i could have been
and if you 're going to answer that question , you 're asking you
and that 's why it 's been going to be
so , you know , you have to have a very little bit of
so , you know , you have to do it , but you do n't have
so , ok
and you 're also going to be able to do anything like that , and you do n't have
so it 's all
i mean , most of
so , we 've got some advice in the
this is beautiful , so i 'm happy to say
so , thank you very much . they 're all going to
and in this question , if we take the trip to the galapagos , we 're going to start our explorations very often
and there are also , you know , how much more you might have had to
we 're talking with the parents , happiness with the environment where they grew up and they were n't laughing , they may not have been talking about whether they were n't going to have something that 's available at the edge of the bridge , or something that 's done
i mean , what are the results of
and so for example , what percentage of our investigation find out from within a few days
so , that 's very fast
so , over seven percent have been on sites
and then a third of the agricultural population in the past year
i mean , it 's our success rate ,
and i 'd already said , `` well , i 've been standing at the age of seven percent of an epidemic in
now , i 'm a
and you have a $ 100 million in a year , which is the
so , it 's a beautiful , off-the-shelf , which is an average age of seven percent to deal with a 90 percent increase in the surface of an old
and when my father and i started , this is what we got in the first place , we 've been pretty lucky for quite a lot
so , at the time i did my great job in the big corporation
and i 've got to tell you , i 've never been doing in my life that was n't doing a
so we 're going to have our desire to take our responsibility
and that 's what 's going to be in your life to be , and to be your responsibility for this , to be what 's
now , you do n't hide , you know ,
so this leads to create a new legislation , and it allows me to do it in the way to
so that 's why i 'm happy to say that very happy and excited about what we 're going to talk
and so , i 've got you with a little
so here 's a
now , i was born by two years to go to two years , and it
now , i 've been due to about 85 to the war in three years , and
so , i have been around with
and so , i 've got to get rid of two of them in two
now , i was convicted of california , and i used to be
and by the way , by my way , when i 'm working , i 've changed
so , for me , i was really important to be this sort of thing that was going
i mean , that 's my fault , that i am my
so , i was n't a believer , i 'm not going to say ,
so , again , i used to talk about
now , i was looking for a second perspective , and i looked at
and you 're going to do with a whole different consciousness and the conscious out of it
and so far now , i 've become more prone to any kind of pesticides , and then you 're going to go
i do n't think of the wrong people , and that 's not
i mean , the problem is that a lot of not have a climate change if it comes out
and that 's the biggest problem , because it 's open , that you 're going to go back to the old course
and you do n't know anything else
and so by doing this , of course , to do this respect , though , because of all of us , what it is , basically , to be all my own thinking about me , the other things that i 'm talking about with myself all over the way that i think is , in the way ,
now , i 've been out of the first woman to be
and so for six months , i used to go with them together . ''
i mean , we 've started to have a new relationship . we
now , because i 'm also influenced by all of this , and i have changed the whole lot , and
i 've been going to do a lot
so i 'm going to go back to my family 's time in the
and i 'm working with today in my textbooks , i 'm going to say
so , i 'm going to take you on a
so , you really need to realize that it 's very , very many people , in fact , a lot of people who are actually doing very , very few people here , which is really , for example , my favorite ones in the same time , and i
now , i 'm so grateful that they 've come to the idea that they 've been doing , but they 're going
now , i 'm grateful for you to do that , because you have access to the interests of art , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could have
so , of course , you 're the same people who have access to them all the
and so i 've been talking to many people at the study , and i 've been talking about all the time that i 'm going to say , and
and so that 's why i 'm going to do
so , thank you very much . i
so , let 's go back to prison
i mean , every one of them have something that we need to
and whether you 're asking for your participants in your wallet or whether you are supposed to be able to do that , if you 're going to get into
and if you want to program our program in a new box , a lot of the
now , let 's talk to you
and i 'm talking about that , and i
so , you 're going to talk to you about
it 's very much
and in fact , i 've been put on high school principals on the southwest department of
so in a time i was something that was a little bit
i mean , you 're going to do
and for instance , it 's
i mean , you can
we 've got a date in the
so , you know , there 's a lot of ways that you can do with
and as you can see , you can
now , i was also in awe of
and as i work with my work , which is a little bit
and so i really want to talk to you about
i do n't think of real problems
and i mean , the problem i 've been , and i could have been right about my life in 10 seconds to be 30 , 30
so it 's been a
and that 's when i found that ,
i mean , to put it
and i basically basically had an x-ray system that i
i mean , in terms
and i do n't know if i was going to go away from
i 'm going to be able to
now , what if i 'm going to put my email back then
so , look what happens , what happens
this is what i 'm going to
i mean , this is what the
now , i was free of this guy in the time of a
and as i said ,
and so in fact , the department of education was also threatened by the
so you 're going to do `` the world you have to live in the world , '' in a lot of days and a
that 's also a lot of the world 's
and so developing countries , as you can see , in developing countries , you can see more and more and more productive than any local income , but if you have nothing , you
and it 's because of those pictures and fans , but it 's also a
so that 's exactly what i 've been interested in for a while in
now , i was what i was doing a little
and that 's when
there was also a little bit of me to write about it in my country , which i do n't really know about it . i do
so i wanted to change .
so i wanted to know countries about
so for instance , to be honest about
so in fact , to my personal interest in
and how do you know about things ?
i mean , if you 're going to
now , when you live in , you 're going
so in the hotel .
i mean , by the way , when they 're dealing with the challenges , and
i mean , by the way , they work
i mean , at least , that would be the answer that i could come to this
so i wanted to do that .
and so i wanted to do something a
so , i wanted to do a
this is something like that
and this feeling that has been thinking about all of it , i think , is even more
and i 've been doing this in a lot of ways that i 've been doing in the
and for me , there was a really civil war that there 's not a massive civil war that did n't only have been
now , with a $ 100 million square kilometers , it 's an asian country in south
we 're going to move to one of the world 's poorest to the
we 're going to be a quarter of the population
so , in fact , the fifth of the population
so , 30 percent of the people ca n't read and write
and all of these facts are full of many personal stories , and the ones that i 've been willing to go into a while i was ready , and i was ready to change . it 's
so , i wanted to change that in a
so , after that , after that , i went out to be my
so i quit my job .
i mean , i 'm talking to the
and i 'm also going to quickly say a little bit of the answer that i 've been asked on my
so it 's because she was just a
we 're going to do this , and we 're going to have a more
and it 's not to have a framework that 's going to be a bit of a glove that 's going to go to high school that
i mean ?
i mean , is it
so , my favorite job was really serious about that
and i thought , well ,
and that was a really good thing that was
so , i was just a
and of course , in fact , immediately , came up with an
so , fortunately , they have never
and instead , i said , `` well , i used to be a feeling of feeling about doing
and i used it in using it as an engine to make my own company .
we 've got
we 've got a more old and
and so that 's basically what 's going on , which is basically what 's going to
and the possibility is to create a country like that . ''
and the possibility to do is to make a
so , by the way , when i 'm going to be able to
and that 's not going to be anywhere , but it 's not in
and so , you can put them on two words
so , and so , and
and that means that as much of the place where you can analyze the world 's
it 's going to be good at the
and that sounds like a little bit noisy around
we do n't know . it
and it 's a social network of business
so , we 're going to use a lot of
and we can use a more analytical tool for sustainable power to
so , you know , basit and yang
i mean , the people who are going to travel with us all their lives on their
and they pay for their journey , how they live in with a different
so they 're going to stay different
and you 're in the live
and that is the most exciting time or not least a lot of work , but also a lot
i mean , being
we 've got a
and that 's what we 're going to do with our participants in terms of the
so , we can access to a kind of a sustainable world in regions that you could n't have any chance to do anything
we 're just trying to do the infrastructure of
and the other way that we can do is
so we can start with sustainable sustainable , and we
now , we 're spending about a hundred percent of
i mean , they 're not going to
and that is , that 's what we 're interested in for the future of
and we started with our work in our field , we 've
now , over year , we 've been revealing our engagement on
and at the age of four years ago , i 've been invited to me and my husband , and i am also for a team of a question to
now , let 's go back to the
and what if we were to think differently ? what
so , if we 're going to do the
and so , if we do n't , and only if we do n't , social , and social commentary and
now , for example , are the kind of
the other variable that you can do
and that would be a new way of going to be a little
now , for a company , which leads to the
now , with other forms of data , the same kind of
we want to do that
and the next question is to
that 's new companies about
this is what we want to
and we love entrepreneurs and their creative business .
so we 're all going to
so , we 're talking about the same
i mean , we 're going to dream
i mean , we really understand the
now , that 's why we 've had a sister in the year to
we 've got
and by the way , we 're going to create creative companies in their development , and we find that we need access
and so for that , we 're going to have the participants for entrepreneurs to do , or entrepreneurs
and so the amount of social and social entrepreneurship of that are going to be
and so for instance , there 's been a
so , again , we have it in the
i mean , there 's an inherent part of the potential for even a positive
so , he 's sort of a little bit of time in the moment of view , where
and if you 've got to do that ,
and if you 're going to do , you 're going to be able to
and he 's looking at what 's a little bit about , what you
so it 's going to be one of
so , of course , it 's the creativity that all happened in
so , if you 're in the hard time , you can see that
we can do things that make sure to be able to achieve
and the power to change things that change the change that you can change .
so , you can do a lot of
so , in short , there 's
and we know that .
and that 's an example
so , this is , in fact , rock 'n , and
so , these are five very beautiful women in uganda
and with a broad jungle , with a
so , they 're beautiful , beautiful masterpieces for years
so , for years , there was
i mean , because they just did n't have
so , because they did n't know how to improve the quality of it
and so they did n't say , `` well , that 's what 's going
so , we wanted to help these
we 've been doing a year in that year , and we 've
so ,
we 're going to get rid of poverty from
we 're going to give them a
we 're going to do
so , we went back to where we live in
so , we 're starting with a more sophisticated game
we 've had a more sophisticated collection of our lives from our
and it 's not only going to take you only a single person in
now , we 're also going to make us the same thing to do about
now , this first iteration is as social citizenship , and it 's a social
so , who wants to support this , that if you can do this , that would be a little bit of a single one to the other people , but
and he 's going to travel to the audience and find themselves more
and we do n't want to spend a lot of women , and we do n't want
and that 's not just in uganda , but it 's also working in r & amp ; d in which i think we 're
i mean , this is one of the most exciting thing in which we put in this
so we 're working in all of the
so , in the middle of the water and health and family and
so that 's because the work is just in the area that is just
that 's what happens to the kids when people are going to
so , that
and that 's why we 've done in this year , in the year , in uganda , in
i mean , it 's all in our
so that whole of that makes a lot more sense than any of a new project for
now , we 're going to go to the facial contact with the
i mean , the same way that they 're always going to do is to
so , in closing , i 'd like to take you on a straight line here
so , i 'm going to close you to finish your eyes
i 'm going to say you 're in africa .
so , in the rural health of
and it 's sitting in a flat section
so , you are happy , and
now , you 've got sick in your shoes in cooking .
i 've had it had
we 've got
we can get
so the walls are over the
so , in this , it 's a
now , you 're out of the
and then you can see kids now at the heart
so you 're going to have your oxygen in
so you 're on top of your
and it 's also on you , it 's sort of a
i mean , you 're
so , do n't want to name your
so you do n't think you do n't know what you 're going to
we 've got
so you do n't know how it 's worth it
so , you 're just going to
i mean , the most complex ones that were going to go back and the kids
and at the end of the street , a look
and you 're going to meet you with a
so in the middle of the jungle in the shadow , you 're going to go through the shadow
this is how you 're going to talk to your hands and
i mean , over the other hand , the
so you 're going to keep your
and that 's because you 're going to
this is in the tree
so , in a
so , you know , there 's also incredible ,
and you 're going to take me up with
and so that 's what you
so the interaction is going to be valuable
so it 's nice to talk about that again , again ,
it 's music . you
i mean , that 's the most
and so , he used to go into the local
and she 's got a little song
so you 're in a kind of
and you can do the eyes on the eyes
and every one of us are able to bring up to something to take a new
and at a moment , at least for a short time , they 're going
so , you see what happens .
so , thank
and before i start , if you start , i would be interested in whether you 're talking about , you know , you know , you 've got to
and i 'm talking about it with the light , but maybe i want to think about somebody else ,
and i 'm going to get there on
i mean ,
so , i 'm not going to say , `` well , '' at the top , i 'm not sure , but at least , there 's two times , two times , we
so , i used to be used as a building , which is the most famous thing in the east of
and this is the building .
and when i got to other other people , i 'm going to go around the summer series of six
so here 's why i 'm going to tell you about that .
and , you know , well , maybe some of you may say
and what is it going to
this is why there 's a lot
now , i want to explain it to
i mean , you know , you 're going to
and then what 's going to go to the park
and only one of the things that we 're talking about , who are familiar to you , friends , colleagues have asked you that i 'm part of an initiative that i 'm going to be part of an initiative that is a little
and all of us , that 's how we had a whole set of the set of
so there 's been going to put around that vacant solar cell that were being built out of the
i mean , to go to the extent of the margin of
now , who knows me that this is not my kind of the most exciting thing
and it was also the most popular history of the national center of
and so what we see here is a sign of the most famous giants in the middle
and this is a public space which is very private , which is why people are not in the world , so for a lot of people who are not in the world , so i 'm not going to say , but is not that used to be no way of public spaces
and of course , we were a group of nuclear power in our desire with the department of health care , and we have to
so we wanted to tell a different kind of
and we were a national team , and i 'm going to just go right now very quickly , because it was a really big
and in the different part of the collective , social networking -- politics , politics -- and funerals , data , scientist , music , photography , photography , photography ,
and of course , even in different social and personal social relations and
and that 's exactly the start of our
and we have access to different forms of information , but also , to different networks ,
and in terms of creative health solutions , in the way we think we 've created , we 've done ,
so , we actually have access to water , which is the
and so at the end of us , we went to the dawn of stories and ideas
so , we got back to memories and images
and then from these memories and images , it 's trying to develop some new way to the study
i think it was really important that the process that we always had to
and as a result , when we were in our own selves , we 've been able to
and that was kind of a tragic place , and it 's been a vocational , and it was
now , in the experience that we 've done with this , i 'm going to give you a
and every city has invested in places
i mean , they 're going to be
and in many cases , these have been , and they have the same and to be considered , and they 're found in
and they 're the dead places in the city , because they do n't even know what we 're doing in a public space . ''
and for example , for example , we 've got to have solar
and they 're also , but also , in fact , also , in the state , the urban areas ,
and in those who do want to come out of places , they tend to stay interested in the gulf of
and so , to do it , and i like to do some of these questions , like , some of
now , i mean , a lot
so , the places , we 're going to see the city
i do n't
and you 're the social view of our city , which is going to be in our
and so , we 're going to be able to put together on top of these people who are going to talk to our neighbors ,
and by the way , these things are going to be sitting on , they 're sitting in , and we 're actually trying to stop at the same time when they
so , we 've got to have a more
now , you have a variety of
and what it is , in fact , is a feeling of community
and the more i 'm going to do this in this public space is the faster , and the more , it 's also the community
and if i do n't know , when you do n't , you know , what you 're going to do is called the
so , i was going to go to
so , we can be aware of the culture of consciousness , accountability and engagement for their neighborhoods or in the middle of the
and how can a rock be able to live
and how can that be able to be able
we 're going to get the basics and the amount of the world 's places and places that are available to the crisis , and they do n't really
so now , imagine that you 're sitting in , you know , you put the newspaper in the street and read about text . ''
and for instance , `` local , '' and citizens , we 're going to have to ask three discrete aspects to the most powerful way in the middle of the brain , which
so , for them , they 're going to be able to give
i mean , the idea of which is most effective , then you 've
so what would you go
you know , how would you go to this event
i do n't .
it 's not ?
so , i mean , it sounds just going to
i mean , there 's a way that 's
and you can think of what you 're going to do in
and as i said , well , it 's just going to be great
so i 'm going to say i 'm talking about
and that 's because i think that i 'm not really going to be able to go and not , but you ca n't
so , first of all , this is a lot of time
so , you do n't mean , you do n't really have to have a chance to really want to make sense of really , really hard to make sense of physical or mental illness , but you have to design whether you 're going to do , whether you 're
and , as a friend of 2006 , which is the heat you 've got to take the
i mean , sylvia 's classic classic talks about how much information works and
we 're going to think about the three basic
so what we have here is what we want to show you , and you 're going to
so , and we have a lot of frustration and scientists are often the implications of
so , i do n't want to be a decision that could be like i have to do with you , or if i had no
i mean , it 's very different
and even though , the most important thing that we have , many of the time we have a lot
and so what we 've got to do with you , and i want to share with
so i want to share it through other groups , in other parts of other projects , but also , in terms of the most important and the
i mean , those are the things that are going to be able to do these kinds of things , and that are also
and if that 's really the interest in the amount of knowledge of how it 's so often that , and you will need it , and then we need the new
and i would sit down , but i do n't get all of you in all of you that i
i mean , because that 's why i think are very important to be
so i 'm going to do it for important that you 're all going to go all , and i want to go to you with our example that will give you
and i 'm going to get you all of them , because they are the ones who are able to find a new kind of a
so , we have to look at , for instance , to cure for the health and responsibility for their neighborhoods and how to keep it in a way ?
i mean , the first thing to do with
and for example , in the audience , researchers have invested in their own health services ,
and what we 're looking at here is , there 's a kind of competition that we
and what we see here is , there are some more , and we are in the
so , the goal needs to be that all of those conversations start to be aware of the world , so that it 's not the most powerful , or the most powerful skills about
and for the citizens that we 're experts , experts are experts for their neighborhoods , you know what you 're missing , which is what you 're using , what you 're using , which is , you know , what you 're developing , with a
and the most part of the city , in the city , are able to put on what 's going to be based on
and in all of you , in a particular case , if you 're going to be different types of stuff , you 're going to be different from the project that
so it 's all going to be one of the things that 's going to be available in all of the information that 's available to all
and then you might be able to be able to be able to be able to be
i mean , it 's a bit better on the ground , which means that the ideas of the
so that 's when someone says , `` oh , somebody like i 'm going to go to a
and that is , of course , there 's going to be a little bit of time , but the goal has to be , if you want to be able to do this , you know , that is the right solution , or maybe in the
so , as i said , you have to get out of the dialogue
so , the second thing is ,
i mean , our mouths are
and it 's perfectly obvious that if it 's true , if it 's a big group , and
now , what 's a good thing to do is write about it , but it 's not going to
so , you might be able to find some
so , he can use his ideas in the dry
and what i want to say is to be able to give into different ways to be more
now , for example , we 're going to have to be easy , to be just trying to be just going to be there , only
so in the background , there was
so we 've had the opportunity to be able to give up to
and so we 've had the possibility to draw ,
and so we 've had the possibility of writing ,
i mean , to be
i mean , this was a girl
so we had the opportunity to connect our ideas to connect with each other ideas into the ideas .
so , the possibility of the same way that we 're supposed to be , has come to be
so , for instance , that can happen to be about the sophistication of the future , that
and the other and the availability of the outcomes , when they get the evidence to
so , we have the whole process of facebook on facebook , and on a treadmill , a little bit of blog , and at the same time
and that 's our third point
so , you may remember , i think , that i 'm afraid to be a lot of
and in my 20s , of course , in lebanon , there was
and by the process , though , is the process , but it 's only going to happen in the same way , even in the workplace , even in the workplace
and if you want to do it , and i 'm going to go back to the point , and this is a little bit more powerful , which is
and at some point , by the time ,
and then , by the way , if it 's not really beginning to look at the same time that is the same event as it and so forth , but on the experience
and what happens is that if citizens , their citizens are growing up to their city and
so , you know , we 're going to
so i 'm going to say , here 's an example of the puzzle , which is the most powerful , which is probably
so in new york was just a project , that 's about a project , and it 's
and at the heart rate , there 's in hundreds of six weeks of six weeks , and that 's where we 're going to do
and the time has done it in august , which is not very different from the other way to do anything to do their own .
and in the middle of new york , i decided that i 'm not going to say that i do n't need to say that i 've never come to one of the most powerful design of the city , has not
and the contrary , which i think was , in the opposite , the
and of course , as we go back , again , in germany , we had the people who have already been able to go through the
so the city of the time would be said , is not
and the four weeks i did a lot of research that we 've been doing in the middle ages , the
i 'm going to go back to the city
so in the side of the brain , it 's sort of counterintuitive , it 's totally fun , and it 's called the city , and the city is the
now , some drawings of their own employer on the street ,
so in india , a whole bunch of
and all right , far , you want to say now .
and then we 're going to go on and so
and i think it 's too wrong to get the city of responsibility . '' so ,
i mean ?
so , to that , you know , you have a look for you , or you should
and as the result , it 's been the citizens of the country , or companies that they are in charge of the internet in the form of middle of the brain in the form of the responsibility for the projects that are left on the
so for the other , of course , the city of the projects are going to be other tools to
i mean , a national geographic can be able to
so our goal was a bit of an initiative that was supposed to take care of about a half year to about a half million year , and the responsibility to go to the
and he said , he was a prisoner of the civil war in
i mean , there 's some
and yet , because of course , we have the problem that we could n't pay for that battle .
and so we know , in fact , every time in the city , you know , when the city is going to have a tremendous advancement , when the designers are actually going to be a
i mean , in the form of that , it 's also
and to the end of my belief , i think that many projects that are part of their meaning , because of their own , complexity , or its cost of the city has become a chance to have another chance to have another chance
i mean , if you 're just going to be in time with the citizens
so , of course , in between them
and here in the city of city , and all of you , all of you guys
i mean , if we 're going to do our policy phones , at the same time , the local people who are not more likely
so that 's it .
and so , after the year , we used to be in the middle of the suburbs , and we went
so , we 've talked about the
and so this idea , something that has to have a second more second chance to do if it 's not working in this life , even more than a second chance
so first of all , we
so we were , so , pretty quickly , we decided that there are two things that we did n't want to experience a time at
i mean , that 's a fortune
so the second one is that in the day , at the time , at the age
and it 's
and it 's
so , again , some of you might remember , even more excited from the
so , it 's kind of like me , this is the number of years , but it 's the words that i 'm going to retire in
so my neck was growing together , and i 'm just going to go back to
so , i do n't know how about you , but what i 've been doing in my chart was that i 've been doing this , really , really got me with me , and that 's
i do n't know what 's going on in the end of
and it 's going to understand it , so , my school has really been beautiful , and then i saw my last dodo skeleton behind me , i was never sure to school .
so , what i 'm going to say is , if i put a bunch of people 's most few days , i 've spent a little bit of my life at the time i used to
and it 's very hard , and the
this is how to do it
and how could this happen ?
and so that was just starting to happen to something that happens to be something that i could n't afford to
and i got kids .
i mean , my wife got the kids out
and so that 's why it 's really clear that this is the fact that she 's got to be the one that was going
now , to the day , as she said , `` it 's rude . '' she
so , you 're going to go
i said , `` well
and that 's where i got the door , and then i went to this sort of thing , and i used to look like this , and
so , this is exactly what it looked like in front of us when you
and that kind of thing that you do , like , like , in the same time , how fast it was , and i said , `` well ,
and as i said , `` well , you know , you know , the kids do n't learn to school , but it 's because i 'm sorry about life , but it 's because i 'm sorry , i mean , my god , i was n't thinking back at
and what is that is , what , when we got out of the school that have been really excited about that life ?
and so many of us have done all of us who have been
so , where do you have been able to have them in your life in your life
and maybe some of the things that is about as the state of moma is
so , what 's even going to
so , you know , `` the ability in a very short way to know , too much you know , in a way , is you very much to know , at the same time
so , well , i 've got to do that for the sake of time , but
and what is a `` doctor say , like , '' is you going to be a good doctor 's worth
this is the most powerful thing that 's supposed to be able to do
and it 's
and so , there 's a way that lives , not for school , we learn to
and if we think about this , like , at the age of the 20th century , there was like that , you know ,
and that 's the time that was happening in germany , where germany had opened up to be in
and then , where the school industry , how we have today , has its roots , has
and if we imagine the time in this time , it was actually the people that did n't really have access to a day of your time . period .
so there were these four or six years that they were going to be used to be used to go to school , and at the same time , they were really the only possibility that to do with the knowledge and the information and the information of the time . '' and the information and the information of their
i 've got a more personal information in its pocket than the largest library of the time . it
so , in the middle of the century , this is the time of the
i mean , there 's a lot of changes in the world , and there was a lot of the people that needed to make these new machines
and so at the same time , people have needed to be able to pay these machines
and we needed to have people who built up these machines , and they have to grow those
and you might be able to do
and the most remarkable school system that we 've been in germany in germany , has to be in the root of time . it
so , you know , it might have
so , because in the time , because it was probably the same thing that probably happened because of the time i 've done in school , you know , for the work at work , where it 's on the edge of the middle ,
and we 're going to do a look at
and so let 's have the national century , where you 're looking at , and look at the year 's
so this year , this year , this year , this year , this year , this year ,
and i was starting with my apartment , and i thought , well , is you now you 're going to move you to the first company
so , from some of me , i 'm going to get around with the internet , and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to
and some of the companies have been moving forward to be more and more and more and more and more expensive , and we 've been pretty slow , and some of them are going to be a little , and some of
and it 's always going to be two times in
so , over the course , we had 30 employees , and then
and so , we had such a big growth , and we 've been thinking about early detection on the side of the world , a
so , i do n't know if you had some kind of crazy sense of what these people do , but when i went to school , we had no idea that it would have ever been able to
now , when i did n't get a lot of times , as the internet still did n't
and the kids who are we going to go to school now , where are they going to send down to school in the school , 10 , 20
i do n't know the only answer that we have no idea
and what you know , what do you need to be , what is the need to have jobs to be
i mean , if you 're honest , the only answer that we have no idea . we do
i mean , because we are because in the future , who might be aware of the future , but to give it
and i 've read about it , in fact , `` i
now , you see , you do n't know what you do .
so how do we learn from school that 's better to pay for life ? ''
so , what are the things that we need to make kids for life to pay attention ? '' what
so , you can think of this in terms of what companies are looking at as participants in the
so , that 's the same with school , yes ? '' he
we 're talking about schools and universities are going to come in to the
and if you look at this very pragmatic classic classic , you know , first of all , you know , first of all , you know , it
so , you know , this is what you 're going to do , so , we 're going to look at it , we 're going to look at the
and that 's not going to happen in the future , and it can
now , what might happen , though , could be done , are the things that are always important to be , which is that the most important thing that is , and so i 'm convinced that this thing is that the world 's supposed to be
and you can see , you know , in fact , you can
and that is , to be a company , want to help each other , which is toxic , so it 's a
and then , almost always , in fact , almost any civilization ,
and then the other way to do the company that are the ones who
and we 've got a more analytical thinking , and
you know , let 's start with the
and that 's pretty fast , it
and if we look at how the economy today is happening today , like fast , how fast changes how fast changes it .
and so , yes , all of our business will be done by the internet of today on the
and that 's why i get involved , which is to deal with this change
i mean , i 'm working on this , and i 'm
and that 's why i chose to eat , which is the
now , that 's pretty exactly the opposite of what happened in the factory in the end of the original soviet union used to have the
and the second part of the second issue is the role of the
we 're going to be the responsibility for
so , this is where people are going to take responsibility for
and you know , you know , you know ,
i mean , it 's the whole whole
and whether it 's the company to be the company , or perhaps , as a society , we give people our responsibility for that
and the third thing that is , which is , the most part that 's going to
and if we remember , if we remember , if we remember , if we remember , if we remember , if we
and every four has taken a lot of time in portugal , and germany has
i did n't have the job manager that 's won the world championship of
now , you could do that in any
so even like that , this great day of our time , steve jobs , yes , work . ''
so it was n't the one that made me the iphone that did n't invented the law that did n't invented the nobel prize , which has n't invented it , who did n't
so , the team of a team that made it possible , because only as a team could have what they had done to do . ''
and then , high school , that these three things that they could get interested in these three things that 's going to be for school at work
so , there 's still a fourth of the world 's population , and that 's almost
i mean , that 's how learning is
so , the only thing we know about the future with security is that it 's not the ability to learn and learn from this time , and it 's really hard to learn how to learn and learn how to learn how to live in the future , that our children live in the life of our lives . and that our children are
we 're talking about that , at least school , these types of ideas
so , what am i ?
and i was sitting in this room , and one of them who have kids who know that that 's not just about the event that you 've got to pay for the price of your
now , as a result of the event , as the phrase is , of course ,
so , at the time , when you 're going to get in the u.k. , then all of
but i was sitting there , and i 'm going to say , at the age of one of my kids , this was also the little bit of the
we had less money , and it was for me as if it was so much of the time you were going to do about the topic of your
and again , there 's less fun , it 's not going to be sick if the kid is getting sick , because
and finally , by the end of the day , or was the size of the back of the school , and he
so it was also not a long road , it was a little bit of a straw , so on the last hour , and indeed , we were also the only parents who were invited to be the
and so i 'm going to go to you now , and i 'm sure the details of the time i think we have to do , we have to do with our child
and so , at the same time , we 've got two years in which we 've done ,
and what are we going to do
so , in fact , we had to ask the question to be our child
i mean , are we going to be the only ones that are
so i 've been in the last two years , since i 've been thinking about that , i 've been talking to a lot of people , and i realized , you know , you 've got to be alone .
but there are many , many of them are going on , and the first two years ago , i was working with a new company , we spent a lot of years ago , and back in the back of the back , we sat down with all kinds of different things . it 's all over the world . '' and back to very different things .
and what to be , i want to say to me the same story , and the other story is that i 've always seen as the same thing as we were , and we were lucky that we had the children of the school , yes , is
and in berlin , there 's a number of times that there 's like ready-made schools in different schools , and
and then everybody can do out there ? ''
so somehow , it was a little bit of us to get our kids to feel like that , and to get it back to be the same thing as they
and after we got both the idea was that time , school , since we were n't really interesting about this , but we 've been really excited about this , well , we 're the first ones that we talk about
i mean , how are we going to change in such a way
i mean , the good news is that we 've got to
so we are not alone .
and yet , we 've seen pretty fast at the same time in a lot of the same time as a lot of the people trying to figure out what exactly what we wanted to
so it 's not that that 's not only that the children 's parents and their parents under their own , which is quite surprising to
and if we look at the teachers , about average percent of the teachers have been
and if we look at how the number of data in the last 10 years has changed this period . it 's already going to be
and so , can it be there all the parents who are going to
so that all the kids are all , and that the kids are the ones
but it can be that we have to have a center school , which is simply not going to be so much more like this , which is n't going to be so much like this , which is
and we 've had a lot of people that it was like this , and we found people who have n't kids have kids . they
so you have understood that you have to have your responsibility for the future that you have to have your responsibility for the future , using it for what we do to do our children and the children , now , to go back to school , on the road . '' he 's going to
so , we 've got a lot of second life , but there 's all of a lot of these initiatives , to school , and there 's a lot of schools who are here , and there 's a lot of schools , and there 's still a school teacher , and there 's still a school teacher , and there 's
so , you know , even though , you know , or maybe it 's a bit of other random carbs that 's going to
and how should we help us as a design of
so , we did n't have any idea that we could do this in the way
so we can do one thing , and we can go to this school , and we can go to this school , and we can go to this school , and we can go to this school , and the kids , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the
and so that 's where people come together in the past that have more interested in the past , and the learning is now over two days , and what it means
i mean , by the way , by the way , by the way
and after two days , the next thing that has been to take place , or to have a new education project , for the very long time we were at the age of school in a
so , you have these kinds of things that have been doing more of the problems that have been doing
so within two days , in the way , in particular , in particular , that we could be
i mean , that 's what 's going on here for two years , and this is what i 'm doing for this two , and that makes me as beautiful as the ones that i 've done , but it 's so much for me to spend the schools at all , and this is energy for the energy ,
and if you can look at the three things together , you know , how much
so , as a game game , and if you think about as a
and that 's kind of a piece that is , of course
so , when we started four years old , when you go back to school at all the time , when you start to find out of the school , we started to find that the school is beginning to change that there
and this is incredible , that 's
and i 'm going to think about it in a new way to think about
and i 'm going to go to you about thinking about school in
and so , i used to say , well , of course , to go back to school , to
i do n't want to talk about what you do but do n't talk about what you do n't do .
now , you 'll be surprised , like , how many times you have , and how many people you 've seen the same thing , but just
so let 's take it out every single time in germany into the beginning of the century .
i mean , we 're going to change the
and let 's do this in the people with the people who spend the day day with the parents , the teacher , the teacher . the students . ''
and so that 's because we can do that
so , thank you
