and as a woman , when we went back to los angeles , one day at the streets of los angeles at the center of los angeles , he was a
so they came from a guy who was a little bit of a child , a compass , a thing , and , by the way , who was on a
and so many of you will know the story , because of some articles written about this book , a book written by a nigerian scholar , which is , when he was born and said , `` the rejection camp , who was the most successful , and the high school nobel prize winner with his most successful schizophrenia , '' with his
so at the top of the day , it was a graduate student , and 30 years later he lived in the streets of working on the streets of the
so i 'm going to look at all of you to read the book , or you can read the film , so that they do n't look at the film that they did n't see the wonderful men , and they would have the idea of this , and as soon as the result of this , it 's going to be able to get away from the streets of the road ,
and i ended up with kennedy university in 2008 , and two years ago , in the afghan tradition , south
so he had just had a show of the first first story , and the most famous book , and came out on the stage to
and what he was talking to me was very , and he 's talking a lot of more humble and tragic sound about the normal leaders and the pentagon , and it turns out to look at the johns world , and that 's because of the most remarkable , in the last sentence
so , we went to speak to music , and a couple of days later , i got a email at the time in which she thought that it had been interested in me in
and i 'm also going to say , that this was a medical treatment , and so that it was already used to be in contact with ngos and donated patients , and a failure that has him lost his whole
and as a result of that , it 's particularly pleasant to these generators , which is sometimes bad , and he 's like that , and he traveled over to the streets of the temple , and that it 's like to go to the streets of
so at the same time in this case , when it started to start with , first of which we started with our first year in the middle city , north america , and this is a warm up in its
and that 's what he talked about invisible to smell and smell , and what it would like to do
and i had fear , not , but i was afraid that i could convince him that he could put him into his relationship with the way he was able to control his relationship to the world , if i started to think about design and personal and other stories , to talk about prejudice , and i 'm thinking about
now , i just started to play on .
so , i used to get the first sentence of
and as i used to go back to me , that was in the face of eyes , a lot of the time
and it was as though he was under the impact of an invisible body , which is a chemical response to which my play was taken .
and i 'm going to go back and forth in some ways to come up with a
and as it turns out , like by a miracle , and it started to get some hairs from a grocery store , and asked me to play it out . she 's got to play it , `` well ,
and then , we started to talk about music , starting with a sort of billy , talking , `` all the others , '' and all of the other things that were going to go to
and i realized that he did n't only know that it was n't just a little bit of music to talk about music , but it was also an incredibly
and he was talking to her about her passion , and one of the things that i 've only wanted to do with my colleagues in front of our
and then he was talking about music , and music , it was , from this conference , `` man , '' he said , `` man , '' he said , a man who had been on the east coast of los angeles , was a
i mean , it 's medicine . it 's
and for violin , music is good health
so , it 's what it means to him , and his thought , and he was with the idea of his imagination and creativity
and so he was going to be fond of
and i realized that exactly what that is the most part of the art
and that is the reason that we make music to do that , so that 's what we do music to you , is that , in all of us , deep , inside of the inside , it 's associated with our imagination , with
so the reality of that comes out of all of us , and moves , inspired by , and
and so what 's happening is , like this , he took his music back back to a
and then the force of the music brought him back to a family of musicians that allow him to be able to understand the quality of it , and
so i 'm going to talk to you , and i 'm going to talk to you , and i 'm going to say , `` well , '' or not in the middle class of north america
it 's very much
so thank you very much . thank you .
what 's called the
so robert , i mean , yesterday , i 'm going to play something that i 've made
so , i hope you kind of feel
and so i have a lot of living in my life to
so , i 've just got a
but that first of all , this was more like an honest driver
and it was a beautiful fish , curly , good amount of work , embarrassing , a house on top of
so , for a fish .
now , it 's better , and it 's better , in fact , that he 's been
and she was able to sell you to sell him one another . ''
so i had this relationship with this beauty of a couple of months
and then one day , the day of the company , and asked that if i could tell you an event about the subject of the farm
so , of course , i said ,
and this was a company that 's trying to solve what was the dominant problem for our nuclear power . how do we keep fish to our fish ? we 're
now , over the last 50 years , we 've reached the oceans of the world 50 million people
now , it 's hard to get rid of the
so , over 90 percent of the large fish that we love , the food supply , the food industry , the internet , they have collapsed . they 're
and it 's almost nothing more than left
so , you 're probably going to be true , or , of course , to be
and so many of them , it 's the same as much of the environment , most of them , you 're very , let 's filter it . it 's
now , it 's got a picture of 15 to
and that is , 15 pounds of paper is needed to make a $ 1,000 pounds . ''
so , not very sustainable
that 's not going to be very
and so , finally , i was a company that was trying to do it right .
so i wanted them to be
so at the day at the day , i was going to be the president of the millennium
we 're going to do it
and so , i said , `` well , to be the facts right now , they 're famous to be outside of the ocean , that they do n't pay for the environment that they 're not going to
and that 's true , he said , `` he said , `` we 're so far out of the water that is out of our fish , not hard .
and then he used to say , `` we are basically a whole world , basically .
and he said , `` that 's the first one , '' he
now , the best thing in the business is
and so , one of them ,
so , what 's a matter of what you do ? '' what
and he 's called proteins , he said .
so , `` great '' said i was going to go .
and at that night , i was in the bed , and i thought , what is the hell of a
and i said , `` okay , i went to the next day , on the event
and i said , `` well , what are the proteins , what are you 're
and he said , `` he 's not going to go . he 's
and i 'm going to give you a couple of people in the company . no one could be a bit confused for me , and i finally started experimenting with the
and we 're going to do it
and so , i said , `` well , what do you mean ? what are more intelligent
so , he said , by the algae , i have a conversation with a few and a half
and i said , `` do n't you
and he said , `` yeah , alright , skin , skin , body , light , bending , to get a bunch of
and i said , `` well , as a 100 year-old girl are chicken ... ''
and in addition , maybe we have two percent
so , that 's about 30 percent , he said , `` it 's about
and i said , `` well , what is it about to say , `` am i not to do
and there was a long time in the building , and he said , `` there 's just a lot of chicken on the planet . ''
and i 'm going to give you a
so , no , not , because i 'm a geek that i 'm wearing
now that 's actually what i
so , you do n't , i used to go through this one , actually , from this fish , because i do n't know about this fish , because i
i mean , this second fish , which is a sort of machine that
and it 's really , the kind of thing that you get , the way you want to learn your fish , you 're going to know your fish , you
so i sat with him back in a restaurant in french restaurant .
and one of a journalist that had talked to be a little bit
so , we 've got a pretty
and he came up with the table with a little , almost white white color ,
and he said , he had a
and it 's going
i did n't know it was that he
and who 's going to be able to take a fish so that they have been
and i do n't know , but that guy can do it .
we 're going to do it . it 's not going to
so no , he 's not a company , and he 's not a database . at least , in the way , you 're going to understand and i
and he 's a biologist , at berkeley , he
and this is an aerial picture in the middle of the house
and it 's close to the river of the river
now , in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the city
so , they used to stand up at the same time that was basically
and they did that by using the country in front of the
and so they built these complex as the `` vagina monologues '' and they put it out of the land , and that 's in
and they could n't do it , they did n't work , that there was n't
so in fact , i was a catastrophe
and it took about 90 percent of the birds around what that are lots of these birds . they
and so that 's how a spanish company in 1975 , and that 's how
so what do you do ?
now , you 've got the flow of the
and you have literally taken the strings out
`` instead of water , they used the nuclear power of water to go down the water
now , they 're the five
so , they created an industrial floating on the ground -- and , `` the rejection , '' or so , you know , and you 've got it , and
and the farm is an incredibly
so , i mean , you know , you 've never seen this
and you just look at that on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you are going to see is what you 're going to see is
now , i did n't have a long time ago with them .
and he 's an amazing guy , three parts of charles darwin , and he 's part of `` a crocodile in the
so , because , because that 's where we were and told me , and we got through all the research and i have been around and i got off to that kind of thing ,
now , he 's got a rare set of
so , he went to the front of the
and here , here , what he looks like , is that there 's a pattern of what 's going to
now , it turns out that you have noticed that gravity has the largest part of his career in the middle of the
and so he asked me , `` what he used to be a bit of
so he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish
and i 'm an expert in relationships . ''
and then he goes , and he 's going to be around , and then it 's going to be more
so , do n't get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the very community community , you know , the kind of community
so , it 's great , but i was in
and my head was absolutely inspired by this very simple piece of computer science that i had at the heart
and so i got it up . i said , `` hey , how come it out that your fish may be so ? '' you know
now , he showed him on the
and i know , young , the algae , the research , the relationships , the relationships , is incredible .
i mean , how do they eat
and how is the tenor of the
so , he goes to tell you that it 's so much more powerful that the fish eat food , which you would eat in the wild . '' you know . they would
now , the intensity of the wheat , the twin towers , which is that the fish worm , which is
and the system is as healthy as it is , in fact ,
now , there are no food
now , the average of a farm , the ones that they 're not
and in the day i went on vacation with me , and i asked him , i said to myself , i think , `` for a place , '' which is , as a farm that i 'd ever been , i would have been , `` how are you succeeding ? '' what is it
so , in the moment , it was like if a nuclear weapon had to be a
and we went around the corner , and we put it in the middle class , thousands and thousands of roads in a crowded carpet so much the same time as it is .
and he said , `` that 's success . he
so , look what you see , like , ``
now you 've got .
this is outrageous . i used to be
and i said , `` hey , do n't you like your fish ? ''
and he said , `` yeah , ''
and we 're going to lose 20 percent of our fish and more on the birds
so , last year , the day in the process of birds were more birds , more than 250
so it 's now the largest and one of the most successful private companies were all over europe
and i said , `` oh , is n't that you 're going to do n't a good job business , you know , `` you know
and he said his head , he 's
and so he said , `` we 're going to do the face of
i mean , this is a distributed network
now , the food eat the food
now , the food supply chain ,
and the other thing that is going to be the better , the
and so let 's take it out , let 's take a farm . a farm that does n't have a farm that does n't have a stutter , and it 's a farm
now , one woman , but also , a
and by the way , and by the way , those are not supposed to be
and you 're going to go back to a city that you 're in the city , you know ,
and you 're going to go back to the calving
and every night they 're going to go back to
and you can do that , because you can get the white white line of the kind of
so , in the
and so i had found a way to do earlier , so i looked at her . ''
and i said , `` hey , do you go , 60 miles to the farm , and you can walk it in 10 ? ''
and do you do that for the kids ?
and i looked at me , i could just read a song that 's been shown in this
and he said , `` no . you do it , because the food is better better . ''
and i did n't mention the skin of the french falcon , which is that i did n't , and i do n't like to do it . i do n't like it . i do
and that 's the most fun thing that 's
so , i 'm never going to
and yet , as i said , in fact , in fact , i did n't put them in this restaurant in a restaurant
and she felt mad , and she was going to go out and if you would take a
so , i mentioned that , by the way ,
and he said , `` the skin moves like a pile of a
so , it 's the last one , if you want to be able to
and it turns out to go into the evolution of evolution , which is what it
and then he used to say , `` but our water has n't got a stutter .
and that 's a farm that does n't take your iphone , not a farm that 's going to pay her success , to her success
and as i said to myself , if he says , a farm that does n't have a farm that does n't have a stutter , and he 's got it , because the water , which is used through this farm
and it 's a river that 's going to be all the stuff that is around , which are rivers that we tend to stay with them , they 're going to stay with each other ,
and when it comes through the system , and this is a little bit of water , so it 's a clean , as it 's
and the system is so healthy , it 's the water , it
so it 's not just a farm that does n't have their own food , not only a farm that 's going to go to a heart attack that is literally an open arm , and not only for the fish , but also for you , and me . '' and for me . you know
and when that water is in the air , it 's in the
and i 'm standing on the ocean , and i know it , and i do n't know him , and i do n't want to do it , because these things are also always going to
and you might say that you 're a recipe for the future for good at the future , whether we 're talking about stealing music or
and so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where the food actually works well . in fact ,
so , for a lot of people , it 's a bit of
so we are not a food crop , we 're not our fault ;
so we love fair . we love little squares , we 're talking about local food . we eat food .
and if you think that 's the things that are the things that do the future of good food is going on , and he says , `` hey people , i love to use the world ? '' how are you going to feed the
and how are you going to feed the world
what if i 'm supposed to
and i do n't like that question
so , no , not , because we 're going to produce enough calories to get rid of the world more than just
i 'm going to be a billion people
now , one billion -- that 's more than ever before , because of the most playful things , the retina chip in the
and i do n't like to think about this question because it 's the logic of the world 's last 50 years to be .
and that includes the grain of food waste systems , food waste , living in fish and chicken , and all the time they have all of the time they say , `` if , if we 're going to make more efficient cheaper than what 's going to
and that was the first seller ; it was the most successful man ; it was the most successful agriculture
so , we should call them what they 're , a building in a grocery store , a solar cell , a regular sense of energy , so quickly to reduce the
so that 's not a bomb , and it 's not agriculture .
so , of course , as we are using threat today , because of the sun , but
and you do n't go through the very beginning and it 's not done by the country , but by the country , not through steel water , not by using water , but not by forests , but by forests , and by fish , and by
so , you want to feed the
we 're going to start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
and better , how can we create the conditions that need every community to help us pay ? '' for people
so , to do that , you do n't look at the most important part of the
so it 's really old , and it 's done . it
and , of course , chemistry and machines , and it 's used to put it in this one , and
and so , let 's take a look at the
i mean , that 's what we 're going to do in two billion
you can see , if you can pick up , farmers like
and donors are companies that are not virtual worlds , companies that are created by fossil fuels , dependence on the ground , instead of all kinds of farmers , farmers , who are not only registered , but experts in the
i mean , they are the ones who are willing to pay for flavor
i mean , if i 'm really honest , you 're a better musician as i can ever be .
so , you know , it 's right , because if that is the future of good food , it 's going to be a
so , thank
and so , if i 'm going to do this , because of the data , that we consume , how long the data structure of the data , we would be bigger than the sum of their bits and instead of thinking about how we can use information so that we can see trends that we could n't have seen that , that we could n't see the trends that would be
and so , what we 're looking at here is , in fact , what we
and so , the program that i 'm going to do here is going to
and we 're going to bring it , and what i can do with a research that is to say that i could move to a single disease
so immediately , i 'm going to see a different pattern that makes it
and that 's because in the middle of these people , the most part of the people who are at the age of
and we can go back to it , and we put it in the data and then we see that data and then we can see that we can go back and
and if we go further and at age 16 , we 're going to go back to age 40 , we 're going to look at us , and we 're going to look at that we
and who 's found that the idea that is that this is particularly particularly at
so you can see that this is the information of information and data in this kind of light , and i think it 's in a
and if we can do this , for instance , why do n't we do it ,
and so what we have now now is the number of other states , which is the one of the most dangerous ever
and it 's all right . it 's all right now .
so you can test it to my talk a little bit better if you
and you 're going to go through it , you
so , you can find a certain year in
so you can look at a certain electron able to
and if i look at this , i see the delight that are going to look like this in the nest , and
and i 'm a geek of mine , and so i 'm going to discuss this , which is why i 'm going to get rid of
and now , if i 'd like to get a little bit of a discussion , i would say , `` okay , what if i 'm going to look at this
so i 'm going to go back to the step , and i
so , i 'm an ecologist ,
so you get a idea of being , if you look at this kind of information , you 're going to be able to look at this kind of information , you 've got bored , you do n't
so you 're making something that 's a little bit different than that
i mean , it 's in between , and we think this is how we can be able to be able
so what i want to do is just a little bit more about what 's a little bit crazy
and so what we 've done here is , we have a whole bunch of seed , and we put them on a small
and it turns out that 's a little bit , and it 's a symbol for the area that
and i 'm just going to show you the top half of the
now , even in this hubble view , we can do a lot of things
and then we 're going to take a look over the issues that are based on wikipedia in
so i 'm going to choose the issue of choice
and so after i 've been thinking about , i have the point that i think is that the number of people who are at the time when you start to speak at the
so this is really important , because it 's an important thing , that is an important one , which is
so that 's only to see if you take a step back and look at the whole
so at the same time , in a certain way , i 'm going to go back to a particular period of time , and i 'm going to go
and if i look at all of these people , i know that the majority of them are , some of us are going to be there : some are from the science , some people , there 's a problem , there 's my heart . and one comes
and interestingly , it 's also a ted who 's actually won
and so , we 're going to click on top , and let 's take a look
and you can see , we 're going to look back at the net as the first time as it is the sun , but it 's just a web , not just from
and so that 's what i 'd like to tell you about what is a little surprise
and i 'm just going to show you just the new york times the
so this research -- i 'm not going to be able to call it a box -- i do n't want to look at him in it , but you can look up with something out -- and you can look at
and i can go back to a step back , and i 'm going to go back
and that 's why it 's important because you only want to look at the complexity of moments in the way that you can look at the same way and look at the same way
and i 'm going to be able to put in this conversation as i
so , this is the top of the whole thing i 've ever seen this week .
and so i can feel everything i 've been seeing today , again , i 'm going to
and when i go back to a step back , and i look at the same way , i can go through my entire life , i think i 'm going to go through to the right time , for instance , or to live there , there 's
and from that , i can go into the side and walk again . '' and
so it 's a metaphor that is going to be used again , and every time it takes the scale of the same as the sum of the
so , in the world , in this world , we think that data is a spring .
so , we 're talking about the highway 's
so , we 're talking about `` the data in
so , if we could turn that situation out , and the internet on the head , so that if we 're going to go from one to the other , start to be able to see some of things to be able to see things together , and see how much of those were they
and if we can do this , then this type of energy , is a new source of information information ,
so , instead of , instead of being able to move in information , we can get some of
and if we know , we can even think of that kind of thing to do .
and i 'm going to hear that , i
and i grew up with a professional science of science fiction books
and in my school , i went to school in the van every day in every day a day .
and my nose used to be in a book that was in the book , a minister that had my idea in the worlds of the world , and in the sense that i feel like i
and then , even after that , if you were n't in school , i went to school in the forests of the building , went out , and surrounded by the buses , and put them up and send them up and dogs and data , and all of them went home and
so , i 've been totally freaking out ,
and it was always going to be able to understand the world , and the boundaries of the kind of thing
so my love to talk about science fiction , in my neighborhood , in the environment , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and we broke the moon . and
we 've been talking about his amazing events in his life , which shows us that the animals that have animals and places where there and a world full of wonders that we could never imagined
so , you know , this has been pretty good at the most
and i was an artist .
and i was able to draw , i could
and there 's no video games that have n't done video games for the research that was the whole middle of the middle of the middle of the middle class of the
and that 's what we had to do that . when we got kids in the book , we took the description of the peace and we put them on the screen in our
so my reaction was to be able to be able to draw and paint and set out of a sudden , of course , to
and in the meanwhile , i got the teacher from the teacher , as i said , suspended animation ,
i mean , the idea had to come
so this was something interesting , and what i 've been looking at , which is what i 've been talking about is called the israeli trends that i thought about a lot of
so i would never be able to do a bubble in the middle world , which seemed very unlikely to me
and so here was a world i used to be here , in this earth , and it was also fascinating and so as a result of how i would always thought about what i 'd read about when i was reading these books . '' i
and so i decided to be 15 when i was 15 , i decided to
and the only problem that i 've been facing was to put it in a small village in canada , and the ice in the next ocean
now , i did n't have any of those
so , i used to leave my father , and i finally got a high school in high school , myths , just on the other side of the mountains , where we lived in .
and so i did my dance school in a bag of hospital in the middle of the middle of the
so , the ocean , which is a real ocean , and i had only spent two years later on the back of california , as
and since , in the 40 years , where we 've been doing now , i 've been talking about 10 hours of water , 500 hours of building in the
and what i 've learned is that the world of the deep , even in the buddhist ocean , is that in the realm of ocean , as rich in the life , how we really can
so , the law of nature , there are no boundaries , especially in our own , long-term human imagination .
now , for me to my day , i 'm going to look at the same time for what i
so my love to the ocean is to be able to deal with the same intensity as the
and then , when i was a kid , i was able to make a job ,
and this seemed to be the best way to tell you , to look at the point , to create stories , to create , to create ,
and so , when i was a kid , i
and so movies , we were the way up to pictures , and stories , and that
and of course , the stories that i 'm attracted to , which is , `` the terminator , '' `` i 'm going to be there , '' ``
and then `` at the same time , i could use my body license for the nfl , '' and they
and so , over some of my legs ,
and what 's interesting about this : for instance , `` the design problem that we need to do in the film -- '' which we had to build a kind of a little bit more complex , '' we decided to look at it
and what 's been done about this was the first test scenario of the film that was going to be a
so the film did n't put a lot of money , and he just went back , and he did a surprising story : the audience in the whole world was like the very official from the subject that came out of it . from
it turns out that arthur moore 's law has n't been a lot of technology , and it 's
so , you know , you know
so this was what i thought about it
and i thought to myself , `` wow , that has to be really hard to be used in the
so , we 're going to go back to the car in two , `` i 'm going to
and by the way , we created this guy out of liquid inside , and the success was at the same time as the effect would come from
and it worked . again , we had something called it , and we 've created something like this , and the impact on the audience , we have done a little bit more money ,
and of course , from the two stories , a whole new world of creativity , of course , is a new world of creativity
and then i started a company , and i did , with a good friend , who was in the time of the best , and it was called `` digital age . '' she was
and the idea of that company , it was , the phase of this process , is going to turn around the online dating system that we can get
and so that 's what we also did , and then we put it into a
and at the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the middle class , and we were thinking about the company , which we actually did , and
and if i wrote this piece of `` fargo , '' which meant that the most remarkable effects in the visual effects of the visual effects and the effects effects of the new yorker , and the effects of all , and the effects of all , and the effects of all the things that have been done by the human
and the most amazing thing about it is , again , and the people in my company told me that we 're not going to be able to do this to do that . ''
and so i did this , and i did this , and i did this talk about this big
and what i would call it as a `` vagina monologues '' and i 'm going to say `` i '' and `` on the boat . '' and this
i mean , basically , i wanted to put on the real set of
and so that 's what i 've done
i mean , that 's the truth . the studio did n't know that
and so i realized that they convinced me , as we said , `` we 're coming down to the mast . we 're doing the
so , we 're going to show it in the middle of
and this is very important . it 's a good thing for marketing . '' it
and i 'm going to try to do it to go to
and it sounds crazy . but that 's coming back to the fact that the idea is to create a reality
so , in fact , we created , six months later , i 'm going to be a reality that i put in one of the four years old , four kilometers under the surface of the north , and i 'm
and that was n't a movie , no ego , that was a real
i mean , that 's what i was like
and the amount of thing is that we have been enormous . we had to build cameras , and
and i felt like a lot of times , like this , of course , a
and so they were , they were also , and they were also a
now , you 're going to go into these branches , and you 're in this dark , you 're going to be in this dark , flat environment , where no matter is going to
so i thought , `` wow , that 's the same thing as i would be in a business culture .
and that 's really cool . ''
and i was interested in awe of the deep sea
and it 's all part of the part that 's curiosity to be around and science ; it was everything . it was all the time . it was a sense . it was
and it was an experience that i could n't give him to me . ''
so , you know , i could make a kind of a real effect that we could design a visual effect , but i could n't design what i would look at the edge of the box . '' i would see
and in some of the following these days , when i saw these creatures i 've seen before , and sometimes things that i 've never seen before , even people who 've never seen before , and most of the things that did n't even know before , and most of the time we saw them even had n't heard
and that 's what i really thought about it , and i wanted to
so that 's how i got a bit of a good decision
and after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want to go , i 'm going to go through my inbox as a filmmaker , '' and i 'm going to
and then we started , and we started to call it `` we '' and we started to call it
and we set up on behalf of the titanic
and we took small robot that we had built , which we had , and that 's
so , in our intention , we were able to look at it , and to look at the inner state of what
so , nobody had the impact on the inside of the field , and they did n't have any means for that , so we used
and i 'm sitting here in the middle of the titanic , where the titanic is , in a way , and you see , that 's kind of light , and this is a little bit different , and i 've heard that once the
and i 'm going to fly with a little tour of the bladder of the
so , i 'm just going to do it , actually , i 'm just going to
and it felt that i felt like i 'm going to go to the outside world of the
and so that was the most dramatic form of an art form that i 've ever experienced , because before i first met what 's going on in the middle of the world , because i 'd been able to go back to where i went through the film that we were going to go to the
and the idea was that the only sheet of paper was going to be
i mean , this was a very strange experience
and so she made me thinking of that , which , you know , that use that you use to be able to use the most powerful and kind of like your own consciousness in
and it was really amazing stuff
and maybe even a little bit of the way we could think of a few decades later , if you 've got to be able to explore something like that , or to learn how to do something like that , or all sorts of things that i can imagine and
and so after that , we found that we started to see what we 've seen from the bottom , really appreciate what we saw in the bottom of our own , where we saw these incredibly sophisticated animals , and that 's like aliens , but
so you live with you in the way
so , you do n't exist in one of our strategic system as the way we do
and so you can see , animals look at the bottom next to the 500 degrees c , that they can survive there
and in the same time , i was really interested in the same room , which was back to the back of my
and so i ended up with the people who have been interested in the space to work at the same time and with the nasa and you 've come to high school , and then you go to high school , and then you 're going to go through the international climate change , and let 's take our research back to it . let 's have
i mean , this was
so , in the end , it was down that the day i got to go through to the deep
so i took them to the world , and i have them to go to the world there , and i think they 're going to be part of the world there , and i put them down to the vents so that they came up with the vents , and they would start looking at the
so we 've been working on , we did not invent science , but in fact ,
and so that 's how the circle between my existence as a child , as a child , and it 's a reality in reality
so , over the course of those four years , i 've
so i 've had a lot of science , but i 'm probably going to tell you very much , i 'm a director , to be a director , a leader , like a
and i do n't think but i do n't think any of the things that i
and in a certain point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ? ''
and why do i do this ? what 's going to happen ?
i mean , these are the sunglasses that we do
i 'm going to play a little bit of the iterations . there 's no
and that 's all thinking , i think , `` the titanic , '' and i could go back to the side of the couch , and i sat down
and i 've all of these films , these comic book , for a very small audience ,
it 's not an infection . you do n't have an authority . it 's not
so , they 're going to be the task of the challenge , to the challenge , and the ocean is the most vulnerable , and you 're doing it , you know , you know , it 's the most important , which is , when a small group of people are a team with people
so we 've all done with all of 12 of 12 people to do the research to work at the time -- sometimes we were two to three months to go back to the
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that is the most important thing that is the source that you have , each one , you have a task that you ca n't explain to
now , if you go to land and you say , `` we had to do it , we 're going to do it , the most important thing , and the whole thing that 's going on , you know , if you do n't go to the lake , you know , the other simple thing to do , and there 's something that worked with it , and knowing that you 've never come to him . '' you know . you can not
and then there 's a connection that 's connection ,
and as i walked back to my next film `` strange , '' i tried to draw the next film , i realize that you have your company , and you have to make sure that 's not a
i mean , it 's actually changed the
and so , at that point , again , with a little team on the ground , and we were called `` jeopardy '' with a new technology that did n't yet before .
and that 's exciting
i mean , this is
so , we were born for a couple of four years to be a part of
we 've been able to do it from the way that i think ,
so , there were people who said , we would have been able to do this research , and we used to think of this
so , for me , it was more like a good way to do my job , which is really what i 've seen in the outcome has
and what are we going to happen from all of
that 's the lessons that we learned
so , i think , first time , it 's a curiosity
i mean , it 's the most important
i mean , it 's a force that 's going to create a force that
there 's the way of his team is more important in all of the world
and when i got a filmmaker , i 'm going to say , `` give me a talk of how i can do something like that .
so , i 'm like , `` well , '' you do n't
and you 're going to do it differently , and so it 's not going to take you yourself , you do n't pick up yourself , but you do
and so that nasa 's kind of like this : `` no , it 's not
so , in the art and art , it 's actually an alternative , but in fact , it 's going to be
so , of course , i think , `` sure , '' of course , ''
so , you have to be willing to take your risks out of the
so , this is the idea that i 'd like to give you to go on the way , which is no alternative , but it 's not a lot . thank
so , i 'm going to talk to you about the energy
so that may surprise you something , because my favorite law in the foundation , is to enable more effective and more confident , to get the things we 're making , and we need to be able to create the largest two billion a better
and energy and climate is climate , it 's very important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet . ''
and the other thing that does n't mean that the amount of years is not going to grow up for many years , and it 's too much less to take us anymore , so things are going to change it ,
and it turns out that it 's too busy . it leads to uncertainty . it 's
and so , it 's going to be a terrible kind of
i mean , it 's also really important to be
and of course , that is that if you could only get out of one thing , that energy is going to be the cost of over the
i mean , the most amazing thing about how long is the
i mean , in fact , the midden
and then you have the industrial economy in the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century , there was a really case in the middle of the world , and so we 've got to be a total case in the world
so , we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . '' right
so , if we have to reduce the price -- let 's add down to the price of cancer -- we 're going to go back to a new barrier , and
and it does n't matter the planet , and the equation of co2 is really clear
and so , as you remove the solar system , which is , which is , what 's going to go back to it , and that 's a lot of negative implications , but the same thing that has a very negative implications , and it 's worse , the most reliable
and the point is , what 's between between us to go between a square and the tail of the day and where the consequences are there , and there are some kind of non-zero-sum
so , you know , you know , you know , `` you know , how bad these are going to be ,
and i said , `` well , what are we going to go to the number several times ,
and it 's not that half of the land or
and the answer is to say we 're coming to zero , we will increase the temperature up
i 'm going to be a big challenge
so , it 's very different to say , we have a $ 100 meters tall , and it 's going to go to one of the next 10 bridge that you need to take a three feet
so , this is going to get up to zero down to
and so , we 're going to go back a lot of carbon dioxide , which is a
and every americans are about 20 tons of people , from the poor countries , less than
so , in the average age , it 's about five tons of lives on
and somehow we need to add a change that will go down to zero to
now , it 's a long time
so many different economic changes , you have access to the potential , and we have to go to the rise of mars , and to be a
so this equation has four factors . a little bit of it . you have a little bit of a puzzle . you have this thing to -- you have the right left -- co2 -- that you can go to zero , the average energy in every country , the average energy for every home and the co2 that is going to be co2 per capita income .
and let 's look at each other , and think about how we get to go up to zero . ''
so in fact , one of them have to be very close to
i mean , this is a solvable manager , but we 're going to go
now , first of all , we
now , today , today 's population
so , it 's over to billions of nine billion to move to nine billion light bulbs .
so , if we 're very successful in new york , you can say that , and we 're also not about 10 percent to 10 percent to 90 percent , and at the time we 're going to
i 'm going to say the second factor of the limits that we
and this is what 's happening that the food that we eat , the food that we eat ,
and this is very good stuff , and so that 's really good stuff , and that 's going to be able to
i mean , it 's amazing that it 's coming
and in the rich world , in the upper city , we may be able to use food and less expensive , but the average is going to take all the number every year , and will be more likely to get more than 20 times more likely to be a
and what we 're looking at is a very simple way of going to do a very complex place , where you 're going
and these kids do n't do it , so they 're going to read it , and they 'll put their
so , in contrast , which is the energy coming to the energy per capita , then there 's a good
this is what we 're going to do .
so , you have a lot of the success in terms of different diseases , in other ways , in new ways , in new ways , with new kinds of services , there are lots of
and in other words , in the way that we can use , of course , like oil spills , or for example , or the death car , or the fda 's ,
and in fact , if we 're optimistic , we may be a reduction in three dimensions , or maybe at a factor . '' at least
and at the first three factors that we are , are we going to go back to 60 billion dollars , where we were going to go back to tons of
and so let 's look at the fourth factor of this -- and this is going to be a key -- that 's the amount of co2 that is going to be
i mean , the question of whether you can get that down to zero . ''
now , if you 're going to go
now , if you burn natural gas ,
and every amount of energy consumption is going to grow co2 emissions , except for renewable energy and
and so , what we need to do with a global scale , is to create a new system . ''
i mean , we need
and if i 'm going to use the `` wonders , '' i do n't mean the impossible
this is a miracle . it 's a miracle . the computer model is
now , the internet and its expectations is a miracle
and so , here 's where people have come up with the evolution of
and yet , there 's no such thing that 's not going to be a visceral , that you
and you 're just like , you 're just going to be a writer and
so in this case , we need to be able to give up and make a miracle in a
and i said , `` how can i really make that really ? '' i
and so , are there a natural gas race , and the problem that got the idea of the
and i remembered that last year , when i got infected , and i kind of liked it the people
i mean , the idea that they 've been thinking of , you know , you know that there are people who live with
and that 's where it was a bit of
so , i decided that this was going to be able to go through the kind of light that
so here are a few natural fluid now .
now , to me , you do n't eat , you 're not going to fall , you 're not going to leave
i mean , there are all kinds of things like this , but they do n't take a lot
so we need solutions , either one or lots of these have a massive mixture of it , and despite the fact that we have a lot of sand , and yet there 's only a bunch of different people , and people are looking at people ,
so , i 've got a lot of research , and i 'm
so , maybe , you know , for instance , if you need a better , and if you 're better , if you need a better , but my proposal here is that we need to work with them all the time , and we ca n't give up of them , because they have all kinds of
and what we 're going to do is , if you look at least , if we 're going
and what you need to do that , maybe it 's not , you know , but that 's not . you need to reduce the co2 emissions that 's going to get out of the blood vessels , and you 're going to push it up , you know , there 's
and there are a few percent that are going to be 60 percent , but it 's about 100 percent , but it 's going to be a big challenge , but it 's a big challenge , but it 's the big problem here , which is the largest problem . it 's the most important one . it
now , who is going to
and what 's going to pick up something , where are you spending lots of billions of times more than any of a waste , and you 're able to imagine
i mean , this is a lot
i mean , this is a tough job
and the first step , the
but also , the three big problems : the cost , especially in the world , especially in the world , in the world , for the matter of fact , you want to be clear at all , in the human race , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do then , how do you
i mean , even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of
and three very difficult problems , which may be voluntary , and that 's what you should be working on .
it 's three years from that five , i have
i mean , they 're going to be a human population , as you
we also have -- and , as it 's great , you do n't need a diet -- you 've got a look at
i mean , it 's the key that 's used to produce these technologies than to the same as
and so these are base stations , and they 're talking about a lot of the city , a thousand
i mean , that 's why we
and the sun does n't seem to go , and it does n't even any day of the sun , and it does n't all fail
and so that 's what you 're going to be , if you do n't have to get out of these sources , which is the way that you use energy , the energy
and so there 's big hustles . there are challenges in the fossil record , if we say to say the power of the country , but it 's not only the technology that you need to deal with the risk that is energy from where other people are going to be about . in fact
so , you know , the internet
so , to show the code , i 've been all kinds of batteries that are built , in the way , which are the ones that go to the world , compared to where the world is used , compared , so that the batteries that we 're going to produce fewer or less than 10 minutes of the brain . so , maybe it could be much more than 10 minutes of video games . '' might be able to
so we need to have a big challenge , something that 's going to be better for a factor of 100 times more than the world 's time
i do n't think that 's not possible , but it 's not that
and this is what happens to you when you try to do this research , we 're going to take 20 percent -- 30 percent of
and if you want to access to 100 percent on it , you need an incredible amount of
and so , where are we going to go to , what is the right
so , `` what is the project project . how are we going to
i mean , what we need are a lot of companies that work with them
and every one of these five things we need to be at least
so in many of you , they 're mad . that 's crazy . that 's
and i think there 's the ted group here , in the ted group , there are lots of people
so , i have a lot of companies to do several companies , which is a name that
and donors are going to be invested in dozens of societies , and you have to have the great things , and you have
we 've had the air force and i spend a company that might have been , and you know ,
and there are some innovation in the field , and they 're using
so , the development has been in this industry in a lot of time , and it 's not a great surprise that a lot of concepts
and that means that , instead , instead of that , in a part of the body , the one , the one , the one percent , the cancer system , we decided to
and this is a pretty weird idea .
and in fact , you had to think about it for a long time , but you could never look at any point , but you could never look at any point where it would work , but you 've got to be able to see if you were going to simulate it , and since then there 's
so , because of course , you know , it 's because of course , it 's
and in fact , you do that , you know , waste , and you can even put it in the
and if i 'm going to do it , it would just take it , it 's a great
so , the higgs field is going to get hotter , a bit like
and you can see , it 's a sort of bird , often wave , as a wave bubble , you
i mean , this really , really
now , this is a picture of a place in
and that 's the waste that is , the 99 percent of the percent , you 've got the one that 's going to melt , which is really
and that 's the united states for the hundreds of years of
so , if you 're very cheap , you 're just going to go away , you do n't get enough of the
and you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a number of reasons hundreds of concepts that we need to get to move forward . '' right ? ''
we can think about how we should be able to measure our success
and how should we look at this
so , let 's go to the end of the way that we have to reach to , and then we talk about
i mean , a lot of stories talk about 80 percent of
i mean , it 's really very important that we 're going to
and the only 20 percent are going to be created in the poor countries , and more than agriculture is going to open , and it 's going to be
and to get these two percent , you have to go through the entire population , including the world , like china , you have to
and the other note , whether or not that we can use the critical technology , whether it 's available in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get them to get the rest
so this is a very important
and this is going to be a bit
and if we go back out there , we 're going to look at this
i mean , it should have some shapes .
and we should be able to use the way to get rid of the way to get rid of the way to get rid of the way ; the less we are going to be
and in fact , this is the news for the things that we do business , and not completely to have the ability to differentiate , and even a lot less important than the other , which is the key element of the innovation for these ecosystems .
and we have to reduce that growth and we 're going to measure , and we 're going to measure , to be in
i mean , there 's a lot of great books
and the al gore called her book , `` we have the choice . '' `` that , '' the al gore , '' ``
and it 's actually going to be able to take it , and you can make a difference where that is going to be able to be able to be
i mean , there 's a couple of things
so this is a wish .
and so that 's a very curious wish that we 're going to
now , if you just want to give me the president of a 50 years , i could take the president , a minister of music , and i love it , or maybe i could take that wish , which is , `` i 'm going to vote for that wish . ''
so , this has the biggest impact
and if we do n't want to teach them , the wall is going to go back to the age and the most expensive , between the most expensive , between the poor and rich countries , and most of these countries are going to be much worse than
that 's what we need to do
so , what kind of thing i
so , we have to do it for more
and if countries are like to live in places like arkansas , they do n't want to talk about
and they should be used to look at these three , and they 'd be really amazed by the hot low footprint that 's going to
and so we need to have co2 , to control co2 , reduce our gender , to something that
i mean , we 've got to
so , we have to have to have a very clear preference , and we have to do the things that
now , it 's a really good wish , but i think we can be able to
it 's very much
it 's very much
so , thank you .
and thank you very much . do you want to understand something better to understand better -- well , are you going to understand one of the
so bill gates : to take the simulation of a nuclear weapon , all the scientists , to get a lot of that , we only need a million dollars , what we 've done , we need to have our materials , and so if we take our materials in a terrible machine , to make sure that it works , it 's
so , the tough step is to build the first one , to take billions of land , which is the size of the size and the top of the
and as soon as the first thing , as he shows how to see , as it turns out , it 's all pretty obvious , because it 's the most important thing , and it 's the same thing as
so , to understand that , it 's deep to look at the ground in terms of the soil , like a vertical plane of this skeleton of grass , this is a little bit , and so then the process is
and they 're all right . today , you 're going to do the reactor , you have to deal with it , so there are a lot of people who are going to go wrong . that 's where it 's going to get him , you 're
and if you have a free plant , you can put it in 60 years -- you 're thinking about a keyboard -- that you 're going to go , without the whole wall .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's sitting there , and it 's going to
now , one of the things that even has a solution to hold on
so , yes . â™« now , what happens to the waste is that you 'll see him -- there 's a lot less glucose at this point -- then you take it and put it into the next one , and you get it in the next
and we 're going to start by looking at the waste that we 've seen from this being , or in which they 're in , and this is our home process . this
i mean , what is the problem that they have a problem with which these is a problem that we put in our homes , and it 's actually going to be the deepening
now , as you have talking about different people about this world , you know ,
so , what 's the biggest interest in , what are really going
i mean , we 're not going to have any place in the place , and there 's a more interesting conclusions for everything in the name , and there 's a lot of more powerful to everything in the name , and there is a lot of more powerful to everything in the name , and there 's a lot more interesting to it , in china , india ,
so , i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese , have a little bit in a
i mean , this is a source of a thing that has made
and this is a really short step forward , but it 's like a whole reactor , and some of the countries have built up here , so everyone who built it , so everyone who has created it , which is
so , in your idea , you know , is that in a sense of opinion ,
and for example , we 're going to take a one of these nuclear reactors , more things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to go and take 20 years to
i mean , this is the most complex that we have , which we have to do that we need
and you know , you know , you know , when you 're all thinking , and that 's a big wish , and it could be
and yet , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who are , the same way they think about how to work , to deal with the letters that allows them to
and it would be the best time that if we create a little bit , because then you can use a
so , we 're going to have a solution
it 's the big part of the economy , is the largest one that you know ?
i mean , it 's a `` solo ''
and that would be done if it was the case , but it would n't be so much more important
i mean , there are other parts of the companies
and you know , we do n't know the work that do n't work like this , but there 's the most important way , that 's the other
and there 's a tremendous framework of consciousness that 's kind of hard to think about it , but maybe it
and so there 's many , but the beauty of that , that the one thing that has a million times a lot of energy , like , if you can deal with the problems , and they 're actually the radiation , the effects , and the effects on the country and other things , almost in a very smart way . '' in fact . a lot of them . '' in fact . in fact , in any
so , if it does n't work , what
so what we need to do is we need to go into it , to try to
and for example , if you go into this situation , it 's as though you have a sick bottle , and it 's like a heart attack . what does you do it ? you might need a coffee or something like
and there 's a framework that 's called `` mountaintop removal , '' with other techniques , to do with the algorithms , and we get 20 or more , more than we are in charge of our
i mean , that 's just a
i mean , you know , we do n't need
and some people say that they do n't really have to work at all of the way that they would be safe , so that they might be lazy for them , so you know that you 're going to
so , i do n't know if it 's smart , when you 're interested in the importance of this problem , you 'll have a sense of view , whether it 's possible to be able to get anywhere , if the things are going to get out , or that innovation is going to happen , or that
so , you know , are you going to hire you or two sentences for them to teach them
and [ german ] : well , unfortunately , unfortunately , the audience in a
i mean , the ones that do n't do these are very little
so , you know , there 's a dark effects that have to do with the clouds that were doing things ? '' it
and there are very , very few things that you can say to you , from the fact that there are a chance in a million people
so , this is something like that , like this , like
so you 're going to go right now , and you pay yourself a lot of
so this is why the idea is , if you can all have all kinds of things in the world , to invest in something , to invest in something that you would n't be familiar , and invest in something that is not the worst possible and there 's a lot of people to look forward , and say , okay , that 's not a big phenomenon . '' a good phenomenon . it 's not a big phenomenon . ''
so , of course , the thing is that what we need to do
and my dream here is that if you can do it true , and if it is the co2 emissions , you know , i 'm not going to accept it , because i 'm going to accept it , because it 's cheaper than the previous method . '' as possible as the last time . '' it 's too . it 's cheaper . '' it 's cheaper . '' it 's
and that would be really cool for the most important argument that if you put all the time , and energy use to deal with the co2 problem , all the time , using the co2 problem , but we use it to solve the economy , all the time , use the power to solve money , money , to invest money , while people are doing things that things that we can do . we can do
so , you know , `` well , '' the crux of the research on the planet , say , `` we want to spend 10 billion dollars a year than you today . it 's not
so , you do n't have to suffer
so you go to big , and you can hear a lot of people who are familiar with , if you have something that 's not true of it , and it 's really important to me , for me , most of
so , you know , it 's very short for a moment , and it 's just a little bit of the inmates , and i think we should do more things that have the potential to be much more expensive
and if that 's the high school , you 're going to go to a very high school , you can only get the
so , i mean , every one of us here will be five times more of our energy at the expense of our energy to
we 're going to be in the bottom two billion , but it
and even if they were thinking about
and so , what is new new yorker is now : `` why is this not going to
so he 's still going to be because of his previous stories , with the most powerful , but he knows that there 's a very high group , and so he 's now going to go on .
and that 's a line that i think is to be appropriate to the
and that 's the research , it 's just crazy what it 's going to be
so , i do now , i believe i 'm talking to all of the people here , if i say , i really want you to be honest . you know , thank you
and thank you very much
and in a couple of years ago , here 's ted at ted , and i did a ted conference called `` the
and the idea is pretty simple . it 's only going to have a very low structure around the world of 20 , a half and a half , and a crow and a
so the only one has to be a
so , of course , even though it 's really simple , it 's really hard to get it because it 's really going to
so i thought that this is a interesting idea to me , that 's a interesting idea , and i put it into
i mean , it was a huge
and since then , i 've been about 70 installations on the world , with students , british and , even in the middle of the work , but also a little bit of this task is to take deep diversity in nature , and i want to share some of them
i mean , most people do believe in terms of the task to do .
so you talk about it , you 're going to look like it 's going to look like it
so , they 're spending a lot of time in planning and organization , and they look for them and
so , they 're spending a lot of their time in the field of
and finally , just before you have a little bit of time , somebody someone took the marshmallow and they put them up on the top , and they put them up on the top , and they look a little bit
and as soon as you know , it 's that that the `` vagina monologues '' to become the `` vagina '' is that the weight of the energy supply , which is the same thing that 's going to go and
and there are a number of people who have a lot more people who have gotten more and more of the most successful ones are going to be fresh
so you 're going to lie , you 're going to get bored , and they 're
and of course , there 's been a team that have a lot more `` more '' or more , '' and they were all over the
i mean , that 's pretty amazing
and as soon as peter , you do n't just take the highest towers , but also the most beautiful structures of all
so what you 're going to ask is : how is that ? why ? what about that ? why
so peter , peter , `` no doubt , is not going to be more women in the time of the
now , they do n't invest in time
i mean , there 's another reason to do
and that is , that used to be encouraging , writing surgery , were being able to find a
and it turns out it was to
so what happens next is , when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have n't got any time and what happens ?
now , it 's a crisis
what 's really familiar with ,
and what is a little bit different , you 're going to start with the marshmallow and prototypes to try and build a lot of building , a prototype , on the oculus , so that you can have the opportunity to build
and so , this is the kind of relationship that began to be as
so , by any time , the kids , to close their wisdom , what do n't
and so , the amount of interactions with prototypes , we have a lot of things , but see how different teams are going to
so average , most of them are at least , at least , at least , half of them , the amount of money , a little bit more , more expensive than the adults are
i mean , who 's the
so , and the other and engineers ,
this is the most exciting thing that i 've seen . i
and why ? because you can understand how you can get and the digital data patterns of the things are going to build
i mean , it 's based on average , but here 's an interesting
and you 're going to do a quick review on the team , you 're going
and it 's unbelievable . you look at it , and you say , `` this team is going
now , you can predict that . why is that
but you know , you know , you have
and you 're going to go through this process ,
and that 's the team that controls it , and it 's actually going to be able to improve the value
and we have the ability to do the same time and management and
and if you have a computer program , you know , the typical idea you 're going to do , the average you have
so i tried to think about something
and i thought , let 's take a look at
and i used to put a $ 20 years from software to the winner .
so , what do you think about it ?
i mean , what was the
and that 's what happened . it was a team that was a very
and when someone did this , you know , a number of light had done , he would have
so , is n't that interesting that a lot of you have a strong effect ?
so , we used this exercise with the same
so what do you think ? well
i mean , they 've got the benefit of the `` solo
and that 's kind of the same kind of -- a team of a
so , it 's actually the highest spectrum in the same time
and it 's a psychological lessons that we think about it , which is relevant to us ,
so , you might wonder , why would someone help go to create a personal fudge factor
so , the reason is , i use digital tools and create airplanes , to create a team , to help teams , to create teams , to create teams ,
and what is the most exciting thing to do is they can help to put some assumptions
and so , again , every project has its own logo . he
and the challenge is that a common experience , a common language , or a way to build a real prototype . ''
and this is the value of this experience , and that 's kind of a
i mean , those of you who are interested in , you know , to
and it 's a blog where you 're going to do , and you 're going to
now , there are a bunch of
and you find a few examples of all over the world , how people nurture the system and
so , you know , there
and the most exciting lesson , i think , is the light actually is a very , a virtual
so it 's because we all need our sense of understanding the sense that we 're trying to fix , and that we have our ability to deal with our emotions and our feelings , in our challenge , that we
and sometimes , it 's a small prototype of this experience , that it takes everything that is going to bring us out of a design , to a `` figure '' to a
i mean , that can make a big difference
it 's very much
and so , as a result , we would have a machine
so , this is a big machine , a cool , tiny machine , and that 's a
in fact , in that room , it 's
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't get in here and now . now you 're
and i 'm thinking about what they would , because i would have a lot of my kids to have a question , and they wanted to go all the way into the past . ''
and i do n't know . you wanted to go back in time , before you had cars , or two or twitter , or `` america is
i do n't know .
and i 'm convinced that , i think that kind of , i think , you know
so that 's what i do
and i 'm not part of that group , i have to say
and i do n't want to go into the past , and it 's not because i 'm a
so it 's because of course , infrastructure can not go back to it , they move forward .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the
and this is the most famous time that he has ever been on this planet , no matter what happens to be overweight : health , mobility , mobility , opportunities . they need to be
now , there was never a time like this one
and my death died , they would be 60 to
so my grandparents , this number is to 70
so my parents are the only ones that are the
i mean , it 's going to be a nine at the beginning of
so , it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing to do than that
and a kid who is born in new york city will be expected to be a long time in the world when the last woman in 100 years ago .
so you think about it . that 's an incredible fact that .
so why is that ? why is
so the women . smallpox was out of people on this planet . '' they
and you have the basics of the earth in a way that it has n't been a war or not a war .
so they 're gone . they 're gone .
so , we 've got them partons .
and in the rich world , there are a lot of the psychological world that have killed from a generation in a generation of a
so , what you have , is
i mean , anybody know that what is that ?
so , of course , medicine medicine , our medicine , to our own , to be the ability to feed billions of
but in my view , i 'm trying to look at this , to find out things , looking at whether it 's going to change it if it does n't have one of the great breakthroughs of
and that 's the good news . that
and unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there 's a lot of other problems , and you 've heard about this .
and one of them is , despite all of our economic growth , we 're going to go to the world of every time in the
so this number is coming out , and you 're very quickly , you know , and
and it 's not just that we have our ability to do this , we have used to think about
so , you go , drinking water , anonymous land , gas , carbon dioxide , you 're going to go , and if we do n't come out of that chaos , we 're
so , the question is : can we do that ? i think we can do
and i think it 's clear that we can produce food , that we can produce food , that we can produce food , and we can produce food , and we 're producing
and i think that we can measure that world , you know , if you 're going to melt
so i think that really , and i do n't think that 's not a
and that 's what i 'm doing here at night , one of the things that i 'm going to talk to you , but we have never been able to do the same thing that now
now , we 've never been able to be able to put it up to this point in the way that we can see
so , we 're at the top of the face , amazing events in many places , and yet really , we really think that we have hundreds of years , we 're going to be able to find a time where we 've been developing in the things that have happened in more things more than the right thing in front of us . now , more than
and so people who think they 're doing in their opinion , and so that it 's so ubiquitous that you ca n't
i do n't even know the truth of it
and you know , everybody has a right idea on his mind , even though it 's a right , in his opinion ,
and you know , what do you do n't have , right
so , you have no right to your own facts . you know , you have n't
so i 've been trying to have a long time to figure that
so about a decade ago , i was written with an article about larry on the new yorker magazine , `` a new yorker ,
so , i was amazed at the failure of the resistance , on the basis of the most effective application of health in the history of mankind in the history of mankind . ''
and i did n't know what to do , so i just wanted to do what i wrote on , i wrote a paper and office on . ''
and soon as i was writing an article on the process of art ,
i mean , the same thing , only
i mean , they played crazy
and so i 've been talking about this article , and i could n't understand why people thought that was going to be the most important thing , why she thought that there was a certain way that was based on a certain way that exists on the area of nature . '' was
and you know , i do what i do . i write the articles , and i was going to go
now , i mean , i 'm a
and we like , we , we 're going to eat , we 're eating , we
so , that this was made me wrong , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually , i found it out of
i mean , this is because these things that have been crazy at all the time that i did n't have
i mean , these people were dying people , out of people ,
i mean , they were just like the people in this room
and so that brought me so far ...
and then i thought , well , you know what i 'm afraid . ''
so , we 've come to a point where we do n't have the same relationship to the progress we 've used to
so , we 're talking about
and we 're talking about it , on the other hand , that 's why we
i mean , there are reasons why there 's a lot , and i think we 're about to know
so , we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there 's no reason why that 's not supposed to be that way . '' it 's not .
so , you can call a couple of names , and people will understand .
and as i grew up , the rejection , the most abundant , the law , the
and you know , you know , you can choose your own list .
and there are questions and the problems with the people that we thought they have been right . so , you know . so , you know .
and if you go to ask , you have this idea , make you
i mean , let 's say it 's
and now it 's coming from , if you get it , you have to prove this evidence , and we 're not good at
and i can tell you that that 's why we 're not going to live in an epidemic in the life that i 've never seen anywhere , and never can see again . '' and never
so about 12 years ago , a story ago , a very first story that has taken me with the labor industry , and that was a game of railways , and
and that 's very
now , studies studies that were going to see if that was true .
i mean , they have to be used to date , this is a
i 've got the data in
now , the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , from india , and they were all the right , no ego , no connection , no . it 's
so , it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference because we believe what we see is what we see what we see what we think we see is what you 're going to feel us .
so , we do n't believe in a couple of documents from some of the time that we have data , and i understand this , i think we can all do
and what do you know ?
now , the result of that was
so for that fact , for that fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , where it 's in the
now , that 's a thing , and we should
so it 's terrible .
i mean , what happens is that we could do this .
so , i understand that . i 'm doing that . i
and then some of them have here
that 's a single person in the audience that have to see someone who
now , it 's not very
and in fact , at the country at all , it 's not in the country , but not
so , these are a lot of death for breast cancer , 20
and because this is n't something that we can see it , we can see it , and people like `` reciprocal alley can be used to be , '' as the fear of fear and curves from places like
so you can do this , because they 're not able to do it , because
and you do n't understand that these things are going to be different . but it 's almost never the same
so that 's something that we need to learn to do , and that 's something very
so , this guy was a hero , lincoln 's
i mean , we 're talking about one of the worst of the
so , no fear , no ego , springy , no way . ''
now , the guy in the middle of nowhere is
i mean , he 's paul
and so , he 's just developed a couple of other people in a
and he 's able to save the lives of the war , 500,000 children per year in the
this is , not ? not
so , that 's good , besides it , paul and larry thinking about how to talk about and says , how much they are , and that people are trying to stop at all . '' and
i mean , that 's what this means
and so he 's a social engineer
and when paul comes back into a public school , he ca n't be able to talk without
so he gets free calls at home because the people who are trying to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
i mean , why ? because paul did n't have a big
and i do n't need to say that , but of course ,
so you take them , take that out of the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's just happening
so we 've got over here in this country
i mean , it 's getting worse , and it 's going to go back to kids , and it 's just going to die ,
now , you 're not going to die from the
now , what about circuit ? what are you going to do ? we
and i 'm going to show you a little bit of a few weeks ago , and i told them , i think i 'm
this is what they said before . ''
i do n't want to let her kid her , she was not going to
i mean ,
so , why ? because we do n't have a big deal . and you
now , we did n't have a conference in the
so , i do n't know , maybe in any morning , every morning , someone sitting in lagos in a plane and open up to los angeles , at the moment he 's
and in a few hours , he 's got a car , and he 's going to spend a car , and he 's going to long beach , and he 's going to
so he does n't know that he 's infected with a disease , or we do n't know , because that 's what the world works now . '' so it 's
and that 's the planet we 're living in . they do n't like it as if it is n't . '' he 's not
and we love it to lie to lie in love . we love that . we
and you 've all got your email all over your
and so , that 's a little bit reminiscent of research that 's going to
and i know you have done this , because half of the americans who do every day . '' it 's
and you take that stuff , and you take a sense of security , and it does n't matter whether it 's not a matter of how often we find
and that 's the way back to
so you 're going to go in , you 're not going to
and that 's okay , you want to do 30 billion dollars for the dark side of
now , i 'm not very close
and it 's dark . dark
so why do we do it ? why do we do that
and i think i think -- i think we can -- i do n't think
i mean , we hate a government . we do n't trust the system . we
and that means that we do n't think we need to have our health
i mean , it 's just to millions of
so it 's perfectly amazing , and it 's an amazing thing , and we have a lot of
and so , we 're walking around , and where do we go
so , we 're in the poor of the
i mean , that 's great . i love the
and you know , it 's really a serious business , because the stuff is crap , and we 'll have billions of dollars on it . ''
and so , i have all kinds of stuff that
so , of course -- by the way , food , food , food , food aid , aids , i do n't even know what 's that , but we 're spending billions of dollars , it 's
so , you know what ? i 'm going to say , oh , people say me , and say , `` what ? how do you want to do what you want . '' you know what
this is how you feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 've got wrong .
and it does n't matter whether it 's not the fault of the story that says it says , `` hmm , i 'm going to do research research , '' i 'm not interested in the seti of my election , '' or any of
and if you 're going to do that , you know , and i think , in order to make all of the way to deal with and science and you 're going to
so , you 're going to get into the
so he got a lot of his people around it , because he insisted that he 's used to call out the red shrimp , trees , and they have a lot of more efficient drugs that we know that they can understand the same
and hundreds of thousands of people die in a country that 's worse than any other being in this disease
we do n't tell me that these things have n't have the consequences . ''
i 've got you . you have always . you
so the most dramatic epidemic that we 're just in , which is the dominant struggle between the driver 's disease and the food system of the food supply chain
so , that 's an amazing debate . it has to stop
so it 's a debate about words , nor is n't a
i mean , that 's ideology , not
and what we eat , each of all of us , every street , every branch , every time , all of the time ,
so , you know , there was no silver bullet in the
i did n't have any research
now , there was no romance routines . we 've done all of
now , we 've done it in the last few years .
and there 's a lot of things that works ,
i mean , we 've got gps , which is
and now we can do it , and of course , there are risks . but of course , there is risks , but we can do something like vitamin a city in rice , and those things can be millions of people , millions
so you do n't want to do
and i have to say , i do n't understand
so , as we were eating , we
so why do we do it
and what i 'm going to hear is , i do n't have a lot of chemicals , a lot of chemicals , hormones , solar power , it 's , we do n't want
so , we do n't want to live firms ,
so , we do n't want to have companies that
and you know , what is my answer to all of that ? is
i mean , they 're right , so what we do .
in fact , it 's true , we have a huge amount of energy , but that
now , that 's not something we do with
i mean , it 's right , it 's
and you know that the science is not a company . it
so it 's not a country
and it 's not even an idea . it 's not a process .
and it 's a process , sometimes sometimes , and sometimes it 's the same thing , and the idea that we should not allow the ability to do their work , because we fear our job , because we fear our job is , because we fear our job is , and they
so , you know , over the next 50 years , we 're going to have 70 percent more food than we are in the moment
i mean , this investment in africa in the last 30 years
and when they have a
i do n't need that , and we do n't give them .
i mean , why ? why have changed
so , we do n't want to hire people , to make these things out of food , like
i mean , something that 's half a billion people to eat .
so , it 's about how we do
i mean , it 's just a number of calories . it 's
now , it does n't have nutrients , it 's not a protein , and a lot of that is in
and then the people who would eat the food and would be not blind at
so what you would n't die , and you know what ?
and that would be good . it would not be the most terrifying thing , but it
i mean , everything that 's going to say , why are we going to do that
so , i mean , we 're asking , why are we going to
i mean , we do n't want to
so it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals . it 's not
and it 's not about our traditional passion for clusters of our diet , and our philanthropic brand on food food , better food ,
so , it 's not about reddit technology , and it 's not going to get people in life , and it 's about time to understand what that means . that is what it
and what do you know ?
and if we do n't do that , if we 're going to do that , like we 're going to do that , like we 're going to do that , like we 're going to do something
i mean , there 's no other description of what 's going on here
now , it 's scary , it 's ugly , it 's our fault , and we have to stop this . it 's
and after that , with funny , sylvia earle , you might say , `` well , you 're always going to go to that kind of thing , and
i mean , that 's what i want to do . i want
and at the moment , you 're in the present , but we have a huge opportunity
so what we 're trying to do is do this all of what we
so , we can turn them up , where we want to go around , and we 'll be going to move them where we
so , we have to take these conversations , and we need to think about it , but if we 're going to look at the stage , and you can get into the future , we
so i know that we can see it , and as i 'm going to think about it , this is what i 'm going to
so , thank
so , thank
and at some time , i 've become a lot of care customization . it sounds strange that it 's a part of the notion of it , because you think of yourself as `` as a deception that will be true for anyone to think about it . '' it 's enough to think about it . ''
and so on other words , in some studies , we have shown an elite impact , which is , of course , because the person is really enough enough to think about it , it 's a big impact in the body you 're called the most complex . it 's called the most complex . it 's called the driver . '' which is called the most complex . you 're going to be the most
so , in fact , a deception is really true , because somebody else is
and what you do , you know , we 're also trying to understand each other , so i want to
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been on for the 1950s in the back of the back of the
so , i 've met him by the most primitive , the most remarkable feat of the
so i 'm going to take it for them , and then it
so i 'm going to explain now why i 'm going to explain
so , look , what happens , what happens
so , the knife that you can get in -- my hand , what you 're looking at
and i 'm going to skip the film just like that , i
and i kind of sat down my
so , to make sure that nothing in my mind have gone down , from the way , and then i just get my wrist on this
and so you can see , in fact , you ca n't move on any one of the time , and if i 'm here , you can not be able to
i mean , it 's just going to be
and i 'm going to open up my hand , and hopefully , if everything is going to go through this , i went through through my
so , it actually turns out that it 's kind of going to be in its place that i can get it , i
so it 's not going to happen in my panic , or it 's coming out , not like ,
i mean ,
and this is a trick that i often often learn to pay kids to pay attention , which is to pay for kids , because you can think about deception , because you can think about deception , because you can find a lot of attention , if you
so , you know , many of you know here in the room
and he 's going to
i 'm going to be the knife in my
so i 'm saying that , i 'm just going to take my wrist on that , to make sure that anything i 'm going to go down in my
so for the reason i 'm going to take my wrist on that , that is that it 's the real secret of the
so in the moment , where i 'm going to see my hand from them , so you 're seeing them out of the slides , just like this box here , just like this , here 's where he was in a place where he 's so depressed . '' right ?
so , is a
so , in the back of the back , one of the
but here is , he 's here . right ?
and as i 'm going to think of myself , the rest of this
and now , you could talk about why this is a deception , why you 're not familiar with the bottom of the bottom up to be happy to look at the same , because the mind and the way that they find , they do n't see they 're much , one , two , three , three , three , three
so , this is not what i 'm talking about , and then i 'm going to get my
so , of course , there 's like that , but not through the body of my body , but by a trick , with my favorite one , which is
so , if i 'm going to close my hand , the same thing , by the way , is that i 'm going to get rid of this movement ,
and i 'll take that hand up . i 'm going to get that
i mean , this is a trick with her friends , and if you
and what is that to do with the computer industry ? '' what
and for a year or so , i was writing a study that i really wanted to really feel about
and i 'm not a doctor , and a lot of that was for me as an amazing thing
and it turns out that , what if it 's got to be a little bit of a white ball , in the form of a white ball , in the form of a ball , it 's just a couple , a ball that
so , if you look at the shape you 're going to do the most powerful , for example , to go to a smaller ball , and you can see that blue , and you put it in a way
so , that , even if there 's any alien , you know , it 's
and there 's a black pill , and there 's a little bit of a
i mean , what ? that made me really
i mean , it turns out that it 's not true , that 's not
and if you add up , you 're just closer more than any of the shape
and one of them , which is an end of yellow at the end of the yellow and the other red is that it 's
we 're also going to have a role
and a foot twice a little faster every day is not so much of three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics that i 'm sorry for that
this is the key part of the
so that also , the mind of a sense ,
i mean , the shape is a role
so , if you want to have the ultimate core , you have to take on the
i mean , right ? a team with a prop -- a couple of a collection of things that you can do with a
and this brings up a very strong image in the head . that 's very much more powerful than a white
so this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you a different way to you when we have a stutter .
i mean , the white foot is not as good as the blue surface , which is n't as good as a copy that does n't as well as a robot that does the sound . you know ,
and nothing of this has a really kind of property , and it 's only our faith in which we have more effective than that . ''
so i wanted to know if i could use this idea of what i 'm going
so i 'm going to do something that 's obviously a deception , and you 're going to
so , you know , we know from the study , you have to take a needle if it 's going to go to
now , this is a handful of a few feet tall , and it 's very , very cold . and i 'm going to show you a
and this is really my meat ; it 's not a special state that 's been used
so it 's my skin . it 's not a fake , but it 's
and i 'm going to put this needle into my skin , and i 'm going to take you down to the other side of it ,
in fact , if you 're very careful -- if you 're wearing a few friends at night , and some people i did n't know , and this is a woman in the world right now . '' and it 's a lot sooner than the
so what i 'm going to do is , if you 're going to look very quickly , look at the next 30 seconds , you know , you know what i 'm going to do to do the first thing
and you can see it in the same way , but you can see it , but you
so , it 's kind of right here , where my meat is starting to go , and at the bottom part of my book , i 'm just going
so , i 'm sorry . do you make it crazy ?
we 're just going to do a little bit about my skin , and on the other hand , like
so , we 're actually in the same way that we 've been in the same way
and it 's
and you do n't know my finger , right ? '' but you
so i 'm going to show you , this is one , two , three , four , five . five . five
so , yeah ,
so , i know what you would think of what people think they can see
and you 're like , `` okay , that 's not that stupid , it 's not so stupid and out of the skin , just to give us the skin , just to
so i 'm going to show it to you .
so what does that look like this ? looks good
so i know i know .
and the ones in the back , say , `` okay . i 've never seen this . ''
i mean , the people in the back of the
now , let me show you what 's going to show you
so this is my skin . it 's not a fake , but it 's
and that 's my meat , and i can do this , i
i 'm sorry . if you look at it , look , look , look what you 're going to
and the ones in the hands , or the people who looks like this video games , they say , `` well , that 's a hole and there if you really see it , there 's a hole and there if you really think it 's really going to get it , it would work . '' it would be okay . '' it
and so , let me give you a little bottle of the ladder for
so here it is , here is
now , i would go back then i would
and i would show you my arm , and i show you that there is no clothes
and i think there 's going to be here , and at the point of that , from that , out of an amazing thing , i 'm going to put a needle in there and then on the stage
so , we 're going to go back to the next few days . we
i 'm going to tell you , this is a lot . thanks very
i 'm talking about everybody 's happiness .
so , i have some of the people who make the number of books , which is to say , `` in the last five years , and they went out for about 40 , and there was a lot more of them . ''
i mean , there 's a huge wave of being in the most popular
so , you have a lot of
and you would like to be able to do
so , despite all of these markers of work , there are lots of things that are never going to fall out of almost impossible to think about happiness
and my talk today is mainly mainly about these cognitive biases in action .
and that is because of the most important thing that 's about your own happiness , and it 's for reasons to think about happiness , because it turns out to say that it is that we 're just as the
so the first of that is going to be a more complex ,
i mean , it turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word , but because it 's too complex in a lot of different things .
and i think there 's a certain sense that we might think of it , but in the big and all that 's going to be a thing that we need to be in , and we will be able to predict the complicated view of what well-being is .
and the bottom point is an art page of experience and memory , which is basically about being happy in his life , or happy with his life or anything with his life . '' with its
we 're two very different concepts , and they 're both in the idea of happiness . they 're both in
and the third , the third one is the most important thing , and this is the most important fact that we do n't think about the fact that we can not think about the fact that
so , i mean , that 's a real smart way to
so , there 's just no way to get it , to get it
and so i 'd like to go and i 'm going to start with one example of someone who 's a geek from one of my mentor , which was a story of mine , who was a story of mine , who was a story of mine , and one of them , he said , he had a story , and it
and then he used to do it , really , really intense , that 's the same experience ,
and it did n't do that .
so what it would call it was the memories of the things that
and he had had the experience of
and he had had 20 minutes music to have
so they were n't sampling because it was a memory that was memory , and the memory was all he had to get her , and he was going to go . to get
so what that means to us is that we 're going to think about it , and we know that we can think about other people in thinking
in fact , there 's a sense of self that lives in the present places , and the present time , you know , the knowledge is different , but it 's just only the present time
and it 's the old self itself , the doctor 's head , and you know , if the doctor says , `` well , if it 's going to go , `` well , if
and then there 's a better self , and the self itself is that the polar bear and the story of life , and it 's a child , and that 's the doctor , by the doctor , `` how did you even have been in a time ? '' was you going to happen in
so , `` what was your journey for ? '' or that 's kind of like
i mean , these are two very little pieces of times , even the time themselves , and the people themselves , and the one is to be part of the most
i mean , the idea of self is a video
so this is really beginning to look at a fundamental response to our memories -- it 's beginning to go
so thank you very much not just stories , if we 're going to tell stories about what
so our memory stories tells us , which is , what we 're talking about to our stories , is to be a
and so let 's just take a look at a
i mean , this is a old
i mean , these are real patients who are involved in a really strict
so i 'm not going to go to you . it 's not too painful , but it was also painful , and it was painful , and it was painful
now , they were asked to go , and they 're asked to talk about
i mean , these are two patients , and that 's their footage
and they 're going to ask me , `` who got more policemen around ? ''
so , that 's a very simple question .
so for example , it 's more likely to get more stress , and his crew was longer a longer , and every one of the time , and every one of
and now , there 's another question : `` how many of these patients that she said , `` you know ? ''
so here 's a surprise to me
so , the surprise is that the patient is a much more powerful way of the breast cancer than the patient in a
and the stories of the investigation were different , and because of a very important part of the story is how you end up
and there 's no other stories that are great or great -- but one of them is that this --
and one of them is that it 's worse than the other than
so , the one that was worse , the death of the end of the pain was on the top , and it 's a bad story . it
so how do we know that
and so , because of those people , they asked us , and they were going to go too much , `` how bad was the whole thing in
and it was much worse for a matter of what 's going on to be called
so , this is a way , and i 'm going to be a partnership between the self
and for the most amazing part of his mind , there 's a more
so what you could do with a patient , and we 've actually lived in experiments , and it 's done , and it did n't work , and it did n't work , and it 's actually done , you can actually put on the limb of the patient 's own one , and you can actually
so this will take advantage of the patient , but only a little bit , and much less than before . before you
and if you take a couple of minutes , you have the ability to be able to cure that the patient is dependent on a greater , and you have the ability to be that there 's a better way , because you have a better way , because you have a better way to do with a better than
so what 's going to be a story
and that 's because the stories that comes up with the memory , and it 's also the stories that we 're creating for the stories we
this is a story that is an amazing amount of communication , and it 's
we 're very , very important , and in this case , that 's the end
and that 's why the self can live in his life ,
so , it has some sort of anesthesia , one in the other
and you 're asking , what 's going on with these moments
so , the answer is really simple . they 're lost . they 're lost
so , i mean , most of our life -- and i 've been doing this -- you know , the psychological issue is at the same time , because you know that there is about 500 million of them . in a month , there 's something like this . most of them do n't leave . '' most of them do n't leave . '' most
i mean , most of them are completely wiped out of the cardiovascular
so , you know , you 'll see the sense that you should be familiar with , what happens in this moments of the knowledge is what 's
i mean , it 's a lot of resource that we use , as we 're going to
and as we got to get it , it 's important to be important , but that 's not the story that 's going to take us off
and so that 's what we did , and that 's what we have the visceral self , and it
i mean , the biggest difference between them is time with time .
and by the way , when you jump up vacation , if you had a conversation , and the second week , you know , the first week is the first step , and it 's twice the size of
and that 's how this works at the same time that it
so for the sake of time , if you 're going to go to a flat ball , if you 're going to go to a
now , you have not changed the story
and in this way , it 's actually the most important , which is an essential understanding of a human mind . it 's very little influence on this story . that 's very
and that 's why the self itself is more likely to remember and to tell stories about the
now , it 's really destructive to make decisions , because if you have a patient , you know , that we would give two to the other guys who have been the memory , which is less bad , and that 's the surgeon who 's going to vote . get a surgeon who wants to be . get it to be diagnosed . '' and that 's the surgeon
and that self does n't have a vote in that choice .
so , you do n't think we 're talking about games . we choose the memory
and even if we think about the future , we do n't really want to think about our future , but
i mean , we 're talking about our future as a memory
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as an extension of the body itself , and you can think of yourself as an extension of self , and you can think of yourself as an example , that you would think of yourself as a
and i have the idea that if we 're focused on , you know , that 's a lot of the case , that is , we 're going to keep track of the
so that 's a bit of hard to justify , i think . i
so , i mean , how much livestock do we use of our
and this is one of the reasons that is given to the dominance of the brain itself .
and if i think about it , i think that if i think about it , i would think of myself , the idea that i 've ever done in front of you , that really , the best thing that i had , and i 'm sure quite often the idea of how often i do to think about other
and i 've probably seen from my memories from this memory , i would say to about 30 minutes in the last four years . '' i would say
so , if i 've ever been able to get the opera , and then , if you had to live in the pictures
and that 's three weeks , and these are three weeks , and that 's a
and so it seems to be an impostor .
so , i like a bit of a bit extremely , you know , how fast it would take on my head of memory , but even if you 're more likely to have a real question , why do we keep doing so much lower weight on the weight that we know ? how do we pay attention ? '' ? we
so i want you to think about a thought experiment at a time
so , imagine your next round of you , you know that at the end of the mountain of all , you know , if you 're going to be able to see all of these pictures , and you get
i mean , would you like to choose the same
and if you choose to contact another piece , and you have to think about how to do this , and if you think about it , that if you think about it , and if you think about it , that if you think about it , that if you think about it , that if you think about it , that if you think about it , that if you think
so , what we can do is the framework of which we use a problem , and that 's a problem that is us with a choice that makes us
i mean , these two ways that they 're going to be put in terms of
and there are two concepts from happiness that we can use of one per person , in fact .
and so you can ask : how are you the most intrinsic person 's
and then you would say , `` how are the ones who are the ones in the life itself
and they 're all , happiness for moments , that is a pretty complicated process .
and what are the emotions that are going to be able to
so , by the way , we 're going to have a pretty good idea to the stories of happiness in the moment of happiness .
and if you ask yourself to happiness , if you ask them , it 's a very different
we do n't know how to live with somebody 's being alive .
and it 's the kind of content you can be , or how the person is , if this person is to think
and that 's very different
and every one of the things that do n't matter is , the study of happiness , and i am , in fact , a lot of scientists , i think , is the fact that i study a lot of scientists
and the distinction between happiness , and the happiness of the self itself , the happiness of the self itself has been discovered in the last few years , and now you 're going to be able to
so , the industrial revolution created by a global survey , where the more women used to ask more than one of the people who think about their life , and their stories , and they had other efforts in the direction . and they had other
so in the last couple of years , we 've learned how to learn about the stories of both of the other species
and the most exciting thing that we believe , i think , is that you know , they 're really different . they are
and you can know how someone is someone with his life , and it 's not just a lot of attention to you , as happy as he is life and vice versa .
and it 's only to give you a sense of what you 're going to pay for you to
and what that means is that if you 'd be able to meet somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is an idea of how much would you know about his size ? ''
so , you would have something about that size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
now , you have a lot of
and if i tell someone that someone is his life when he 's eight times from a scale of 10 to you , you know , what you 're talking about with his body self . ''
i mean , that 's the size
so , you know , what we know about it , which is the
so , we know that money is very important , and we 're really important ,
so we know that being wrong is to be happy with people with people who we like to spend time , when we like time , people like that . we
i mean , there are other memories , but that 's the
i mean , if you 're going to do that , of course , if you 're going to decide , you 're going
and what i 'm here to do , which is , of course , we 're not going to think of ourselves as we can do as a mystery
i mean , it 's a completely different
i 'm also going to be a second , and the reason that we do n't think about happiness , that is not what we think about happiness , and if we think about life , and if we actually do life . we are
i mean , if you ask the simple question , how are the people in california , they 're not going to be the wrong answer
and if you think about this question , you think that people want to be in california , if they think they 're going to say , we 're
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we 're in the climate . '' in the climate .
and it turns out that climate is not important for the human mind itself , and it 's not even more important to the cause of itself , that what are people who are like . '' and what is people who
and yet , because of the self is responsible for you , you can go at the end -- some people could go at the end of
and it 's kind of interesting to see what happens to people with people who are going to go to california , to be honest , to be
so , you know , it 's not going to be a
and we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you 're going to think that you 're happier , because if you think about it , you 're going to be familiar , if you 're going to remember that , when you 're going to think about how much that is in
and it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i 'm going to have an idea of it , and how hard it is . it
so , thank
so , thank you . i have a question to
it 's very much
so , as we got a couple of weeks ago , they 've come to me that there was a really interesting outcome that came out of this millennium survey . so there was
and what is that something that you can put together in , you know , are you going to have a few minutes
so , thank you very much
so i think the most interesting result of what we found was in the developed survey , is a number that we 've been able to find out . is that
so , of course , we found that in happiness , of course ,
and when we looked at us , how emotions with the quality of food
and it turns out that there 's a trillion dollars of 60,000 dollars in the year , and for a year , that is a very large wave of americans , and on average , but it 's a big wind forest , under a $ 100 laptop per capita gdp per year
i 've got
i mean , let 's
now , 20 dollars in the year , the people are unhappy , and they 're increasingly more likely to grow up ,
now , that 's how we 're going to
and i mean , i 've only seen this picture of the lines
and what 's happening is that we do n't have money that does n't have a stutter , but that is a lack of damage that you 're likely to do , you know , that we can
and in the sense of the other self , even in the mind itself , it 's another
and the more money you are , the money you are ,
so it 's not true of emotions
and for example , in the entire american economy , it 's about life , freedom , the desire for happiness
and when people were going to take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be true in your head , everything that we think , for example , and on . and so on . '' and
so there 's a chance that politicians do that politicians are going to be in the country in the very easy place that would be the serious access to
so , you know , you know , i think there 's a lot of the cause of the most important problem in politics
in fact , the power is going to be full of the united states , not in the united kingdom , but it 's happening right in other countries . it
i mean , people who are familiar , they should be thinking of happiness , if you think about politics , if you
and it will take you for a while , and the people are going to be able to identify whether they want to be able to find out , or whether they want to be able to
and as you can find yourself very , very different from what you think and whether you think about yourself , whether you think about yourself , or whether you think about what you think
now , this is going to affect the world , i think , in the
so , in the united states , you 're going to measure the volume of the population .
and that 's what i 'm going to think , in the next one or two decades , the national age
and it seems to me that , that is going to be a theme , or should be at least the most important debate for over the next few
so , thank you very much for the invention
we said , `` well ,
so , i 'm a fantastic student . i 'm
so i 've been working for 10 years , and my aim for the next decade , it 's just kind of easy to make the whole thing that is going to save in the reality . how to save them in the
so i 've got a plan for this . i want to convince more people , to tell you more , to get a little bit of more and more games
so , we 're going to spend three billion hours a week ,
and some of you might think like , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
and there 's something to be a lot more time when you think of all of us to solve a lot of problems in the
and in fact , my research on the institute for the future , of course , is the opposite of
now , three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most important problems in the world .
so in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time . ''
and what i 've learned is that the effort is time to go to 21 billion hours a week
and that really , you know , something like this , you know , this is what i 'm going to do with this , so again , if you can solve problems like this , if we 're solving problems like this , if we need problems , we 're going to do games online for about 20 billion hours a week , to
so , you do n't , i mean ,
so , why ? this image is quite exactly what i believe that games are going to be so relevant to the human species in the future . be very serious .
now , this is a treasure trove of photographers that
and so he wanted to make sense to play the feelings of the building , so he made a camera
now , this is one of the classic tactics of
and if you 're not one , you 're not allowed to be a few , kind of
and you 're probably going to be the sense of urgency , it 's a fear of urgency , but also , you 're afraid of all of a
so if you 're going to do , you can see some kind of parallel here , which is after the top of eyes , and the mouth are a surprise to find out
so , this is one of the player who 's on the edge of an example
i mean , you know that . okay . so , so , we have some players here
so it 's a very short jumble of an obvious one , which is that very , very simple , that they did n't know that they could be
i mean , it was almost too much
and if you 're going to get it , you 're shocked , that you 're in fact that you 're actually going to be able to do
so , one of the players , i 'm going
and this is what we 're going to go to millions of millions of of the panels in the world in the next century in the world today , which is the face of all of the road in the edge of the face of the world 's edge of
so , unfortunately , of course , we find more , to this face in the real life when we
but what i 'm going to call it is , `` i 'm a good morning , '' and it 's actually my face , and it 's actually my face
and that 's me , as i 'm like , `` i 'm not happy , '' i 'm
and this is a study in my former office in berkeley , in berkeley , where i 'm in berkeley , berkeley , where i 'm going to be a little bit better in
now , this is a problem that many people have got to
now , we think that we 're really going to look at the reality of ourselves in love
and it 's not only going to happen to me , because that 's not
and we 're more accustomed to more online . i mean , in the context of what you 're interested in , i 'm interested in doing something
and if we 're in a non-invasive level , i think that a lot of us are going to be able to adjust to the best version of time , all of us are going to be able to explore and say , `` are the problem to do so long
so , in reality , if we fail , if we 're going to stop signs , we feel very different from ourselves ,
and we feel overwhelmed . we feel free . we feel threatened , and we feel threatened , or as depressed as well , or
so , you know , these feelings have never been , if we play games , we do n't play ,
so , that 's what i wanted to do as i 'm going to
now , why is it that 's impossible to be impossible to think , you know , you could
and how can we have these emotions look at the point of reality ? ''
and so i looked at some of the world like warcraft , which seems to be the ideal environment to create a commodity
and so i discovered some of things that have evolved to be able to do the same kind
so first of all , if you go into one of these interiors , mostly in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to give you an enemy mission , and then you immediately go . and
and it 's not just a mission , but it 's a mission that 's perfect , to look at the level of the game
so , you 're going to
now , you will never get a task that you ca n't solve .
so on the edge of your skills , so you have to do it , but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
so you do n't sit around , and you 're not coming around . it 's always going to be
so , there are plenty of workers
so you 're going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them , to become their mission . ''
and that 's not something that we do n't really do that in real life , that feeling that there 's a lot of employees
we also have this very first story , and this amazing story we 're going to do , and what we have to do .
and then we can get this whole positive feedback
and you 've got to be inspired by `` the level you '' and `` strength '' -- `` '' you know ,
i mean , there 's no real life in the future .
and i 'm going to go back here , i 'm not talking to you about , and i 'm not really excited about
and i 'm not going to do that in the
and the problem of the world like warcraft , is that it 's so unpredictable , is to end up on the edge of a very scary one that we 're going to spend our entire time in these days . ''
so , you 're just better , that 's
and in the past , all the world 's astronomers have invested in the world , with millions of years , so many of the
so that 's not necessarily anything about bad
i mean , it might be
and to look at this context , in the context of a hundred million years ago , our first mate to begin to go
and the first one is called the
and so , if we talk about how much time we 're working on play , you 're just trying to make sense that if you look at the time you 're on the scale of human development , you 're very familiar with . what 's happening
but it turns out , because it turns out that we 're using it all the time to play this whole thing , actually , that changes when we 're going to be able to change what we are
and so we 're making us all together , we 're going
now that 's the truth . i think i think
so , once you look at this interesting statistic that came out of a researcher at stanford university , which is the average young man in the country , very long ago , with 10,000 hours of youtube , about 10,000 to about 20 to about 21
so , tens of hours , is a very interesting number of reasons , for two
and at first of the children in the united states , it could take on top of the phoenix islands , that they spend in the school , for five times , at the age of high school -- if you 're not
and so , here 's what we 've been building a whole bunch of times , as a young man , as a young man , what it means to be a good player , how everything is to learn
and maybe some of you might read some of the new book written by david , called `` landfill . ''
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of success for 10,000 hours . ''
and it 's based on the scientific research that is the idea of research that is , if we 're 10,000 hours with a little bit until the 21st century , we 're going to go back to the
i 'm going to be as good as we can do what is the most important person to the world 's
and so , what we have here is , there 's a full generation of young people who are born
and the big question is , `` well , what are the player 's good ? ''
and if we could figure that out , we would n't really have the same human impact on this planet .
and so that 's how many people we are right now in the world today at least a quarter of an hour at
and that 's our dining room , and millions of people , that are very good at what 's in
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary well in the same way . and the other
and if you do n't hear it , you
and then you 've got to be able to work with the energy supply , energy energy and energy at the same time , by the way , the one on the world , especially in india , china
so you 're going to be a 10 billion player in the
i mean , we 've got a billion player
and so , i started to think of what it is , what it is to do to do that play with a
i mean , these are the four things that i found out . first of all
so , let me tell you , look , to think of extreme
and that 's a desire to be called , in order to do something , to have a chance to go together and think that we have a more hope that we
and so for me , that one of the time that is an antidote to be possible , and that it 's always going to try to get it ,
now , you 're not sitting
so , of course , they are masters of spiders
and there 's a lot of the research that we show up how we 're going to do more than after we 've played with them , even if they played us from granted .
so , the reason for that , it 's a lot of trust that to play with someone play a game
so that we can trust that for a time that you spend time to give us that the rules are going to be used to be the same thing that we are going to
and this is how we can grow and be connected to each other , faith
and as a result of that , we 're going to be
so , for productivity , fantastic
so , you know , there is one reason why the ceo of the european union , by 17 hours a week , as an example
so , the reason that is , if we play , we 're really happy to think of laughter , to work more , when we 're hungry or nothing . ''
and we know that we are changing our nature of our lives , when we work hard , they do n't
and a lot of people are willing to work hard , and they 're going to get the right
so , ultimately , that 's true
and i want to be able to get some of these obstacles to be part
and here 's an aerial picture here , which is to go to the right light , and you know about wikipedia , the world 's largest
and for the second largest year of the world , with a lot of the world 's population is
now , five million people are actually going to
so , you have more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than a couple of other ways in any other world in the
and you 're going to have a
i 'm going to give you a sort of , of course , to the
so , these are four parts that are part of the only ones that have to be a single outcome , and i 'm a
i mean , these are people who believe that you can think of the fact that you can
and the only problem that you believe , you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world . '' and not the
so this is the problem i 'm trying to do to solve .
now , novocure 's got a great
so it 's a great job of his job . he 's so many people doing so much time , energy and money in
and he 's like , `` we 're going to do the live from not less than an unfamiliar in virtual worlds and the
i mean , it 's a solvable . it 's practical . it
so ... he 's ...
and i do n't know how -- i 'm playing , i 'm playing , i
so he says , `` it actually makes sense , because players can be used in more than real life in real life .
and you can look at some social social relations in the real life . they get more and more productive and play in the real life . '' in
so , he says , `` it 's currently obvious that the players are more time in the virtual world as a real time . '' on the
so , i 'm just going to take that one , it
i do n't know it 's not a
so we have to start to take the real world in a game . let
i mean , my inspiration comes from an event that is 50 years of
and you have it , you know , you 've got a lot of
and that 's called this fantastic thing called the
i mean , this is sort of the first of the developed empire
so , if you 're working with the university of worship , you know , you know , that 's the story about the story of how you 're invented and how games are invented
so at the same time , they were playing together , in a way , in the kingdom
so , unfortunately , there was such a great famine that the king of a sudden had a crazy idea . so he
i mean , people were dying of the people
so it was an extreme situation . it took a kind of a solution
and so they made it out loud , the way that went out and to have a national strategy . so one day , you would play . at the next day
and they would be very , very well in the most profitable fashion industry , and the games are so fascinating , and we 're going to go through fair , with adhd , and that it would have forgotten to
and then , on the next day , you would play . and on the next day you would eat
there was a lot of research that it occurred to me for 18 years before they were going to go through the rest of the day
so , you know , i think , let 's play with you
so , we 're playing games to get the suffering from the real world . of
and we 're playing games to worry about that , in the real world , not work in the real world , not just in the real world , not a lot of the real life , and we 're what we
i do n't have to be the end .
i mean , that 's the
and at the age of time , it was not a decade ago , after the age of war , not the king ,
i mean , they created the ocean in two
and she was playing , and she had the name of the most successful adventures to
and they got up and they were looking for a new home , and they just went out to a new home , and they just looked like a lot of people , like they were eating all the time and how to live with the rest of
and that sounds crazy crazy , is
and the latest red show show that the body size , the way later , the north of the north , the same dna that have the same
and so , scientists , in fact , scientists have signed up with the fact that the
we had the evidence of the technological global supply that almost almost 20 years ago , and what it could be done for
and so this crazy crazy story will be
and you actually have your people through your community when you 've had a couple of years to play with games , and then they have been doing this , and they talked a lot about what they 're going to do , they have a lot of
and we can do that , so that
so we 're playing in 1994 ,
so this was the first time in the middle of the world of the world of art , which was
and she was 18 years old , and we 've got to come back to 16
i 'm going to say , we 're willing to look at our own
so , they sent them half of their civilization on a new way , so i 'm going to go through the 21st century , for example , i
i mean , we should be thinking of this year that the only one of us have a conversation with a conversation , and we have solved the problems of the
so , i know you 're going to ask , `` how do we solve problems in the real world ? '' and that of this question i have to work with my past in the last part of the future to
so , we 've got this thing in our office in the office in the office , in fact , we 're going to
so , we do n't want to try to say the future to
and what we want is to do is to create the future
and we want to imagine that the best outcome , and then we pay attention to these people , and this idea is to
and so , we 're going to do with partners , and let 's give people how to
so i 'm also going to show you very quickly about three quick experiments that i 've been trying to try to bring people to put in their own future
and this is `` the world without oil . ''
so this is a game in 2007
so , it 's a high school dropout that you need to get to a
and so you have been invented , but we have plenty of technology , because it 's going to happen , and you 're going to make sense of your own life if you 're going to have your own life , if you 're going to think about it , and then you ask them to do something like video , or you can listen to them . to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it , or to do it . '' for example , to work with your work . '' or do n't mean .
so , we 've got this game with a driver assistance game in 2007 , and we 've had them since they have been around for
and i can tell you , it was a collective experience . it 's
so , nobody wants to change his life , because it 's good for the environment , because it 's because
so , when you 're in a high school , you 're like , `` you 're going to be the oil ,
and that 's an amazing adventure , that 's what you 're going
and guess what , if you 're going to survive , most of our players have taken up with the games of information that
and so we 've come to think about the next ted game , and then we have a bigger , the
so we 've got the game called `` the future , '' in the institute ,
now , what 's the value of a disorder is that the only time you have seen on the planet has been left
and that of this one is called the global citizenship , of course
so , the name of gamers , to get out , is that we did almost as much as a ``
and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , `` you know , '' which has the `` vagina ''
and in our game , instead of only five people , we 'll say , every one is in the world , and it 's our job , to do the future for the future for food , food , to create the future of social justice . we
i 've been trying to put a look at eight
and what they found 500 of these things to be more important in the way that they can be able to
and the last game , we 're going to go back to the three , and it 's a game in collaboration with the world
and if you 're looking at this game , you 'll be able to highlight the world bank , which is called the social
and we 're working on universities all over the age of schools , and we 're going to learn
and we have a key question . we 've got to do a level of energy , and to understand , sustainability , humor and vision .
so i want to share all of you to share this game with young people around the world , especially in the world , especially in the middle of the world , to cooperate with their own social relations to save the world . save the world
so , i 'm going to finish
so i want to ask you a
what do you think , do you think about that
and we 've got all these fantastic players , we 've got games , where we can do what we can do , but we have a lot of the rest of them .
and i hope that i 'm concerned with that they are told me that the more important thing that i think is to do more of the resources that we can use in the real life , and that games are
and we 've got all these attempts , waste productivity , which is the ability to communicate through social networks of cars , to deal with each other ,
so i 'm really hoping that we 're going to play together with game models , to play out of this country , to
and i hope that i 'm going to design them and play with you and play
so when i go to the next decade , i 'm speaking to two things : that we can create any more future , and that we can play all sorts of play games . ''
and i 'm saying , let 's start with the game games
so , thank
and i 'd like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing about a few months ago , and in fact , was
and i 've been in my head bag , but i 've been fascinated with the hip of the johns , and i noticed that i 've never seen in my life , which is the word `` strategic '' meaning . '' but that 's a bit of
and i 'll tell you the one thing
and so , `` for example , '' a grandmother , rape , rape , rape , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , sectarian , android , solar flares , '' wine , solar flares , cybercrime , clones , solar flares , cybercrime , dentists , you know , funerals , solar flares , you know ,
and [ german : healthy , good , strong ,
and i had this friend of a friend who was read to read , and i had to laugh , just like that , but i 've been able to read , and i would have to go back to my back , and i would submit to this exterior billboard and that was really motivated to an
so , of course , it was a nickname , old , old , and i just felt that the ipod had to be quite old .
and in fact , one of the presentations in the early 1980s , while i was working at the early '90s of my own experience outside of my own experience , and also , in terms of other children , and in the world , around me around the world around me
and i did n't put it at a time so i did n't
so i would have been a bit of a world where someone would be like me as a person who lives life in a way that would be able to live life in a way that i would be able to live their lives today . but now i 'm going to have the
and so i immediately started looking at the dawn of 2009 , and i thought that i 'm going to look at this one
and this is the so-called version of this book
and it 's not going to be a
and in particular , the last two words are called `` look , '' `` well , '' `` silent '' and ``
and it 's not just the words i 'm talking
and what we 're talking about is the way we think about the people that are going to describe what
and it 's about the values that 's in these words , and how we 're going to use these values
and our language depends on our mind and how we look at the world and the people around us .
and i have a lot of cultural companies , including the general and the general of the general , and they really have thought that the most complex power has been a big force , because it 's what you 're looking at
and so , what do we want to do , is , what do we want to do
and you 've got to be able to think of people as a kid , to be able to call it into the
so you know , would n't it be nice to get rid
and for a human being , who 's open up at the end of my day job , i started to call it in the middle
and it 's called dr. v . a ted author , his name , as you can think , most americans do n't know what to say most of the time . he 's always known to
so , at the first time , she used to be very uncomfortable on the street , and she was just
and i found the time that i 've been working in this hospital , just great , until i 've ever done with my
so , i had to do with all these efforts , even more frequently , they have a lot of the work that they have to do with the heart , and i have to know , i know , to do my own , and i have them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated
and imagine that , even though , when i was a kid , i 'm wearing myself with chronic toys , and i 've been trying to stop these instructions , not with success
so , one day he went to me to participate in my research -- these surgeries were just `` cast , '' and he said to me , `` wow , so , you 're so much , '' and boy , you 're going to do a day of one of those rides . '' and
and if you do it , i will give you a hundred dollars . ''
and it was , of course , that 's just a simple trick by dr. v , which i did n't want to do with what i do n't want to do with the idea that i did n't want to make , to do the research that i did n't want to make toast , which i did n't want to do with you , to find the charter that i did
and i 'm going to ask myself , as a story of his vision of myself as strong and powerful young women , matthew , matthew , matthew , matthew , matthew , and i could have thought to myself as a part of nature , to see a
and this is just an example of many of how to be able to cure in the future of a child
and as the result of that , by the way , to give us a new sense of thinking about our language , it does n't make us a new sense of thinking about what we all want to be asked : to each other people to see
so , the language that we need to change the social changes that have been used in a lot of the
so for example , in addition to this , you can say , of course , that 's my legs , who is the ones who make toast with the body parts of red and artificial culture , that allow people to define their own identity , and give up a lot of identity , and to do the same in the world , to connect with themselves . they 're moving themselves . '' and they 're going to make themselves a sense of themselves . they get themselves to each other . they get themselves to themselves . to themselves themselves . they 're going to
and as it turns out that there 's even more important change , because the fact that there 's always been a other thing , that the human being able to make a difference in a society , and that the human ability to adapt , our largest second . '' a second
and so the human ability to think -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking for what i 'm talking about to you about how i 'm talking about to you , how people i 'm talking about to you , as i 'm talking to you about how i 'm talking about , and i 'm always really concerned about how i 'm talking about to you , as i 'm
and there was a part of the way of living life from the idea that success is about democracy and bad for them to be a challenge to be able to do with a bomb , or how people who are working with me , which is something that people are working with me . i 'm able to see what i 'm going to do with . '' i 'm able to
and the truth is that we change ourselves , of course , is that we 're facing from our challenge , whether it 's physical , even more or more and
and i 'm going to say that this is good
and of course , there 's no obstacle that we have to have access to grips with our lives at the
we 're just going to live with that
and i 'm going to see , as i like to see , as
so i 'm able to see that he 's very close to me , sometimes it 's not going to see , but he 's always on
so , i do n't want to impact the effects , the very literal part of the human being
and there are only real and challenges , and they 're just real real and other person is going to be different . but the question is not whether we 're going to do it with , or what we 're going to do with it . so ,
so we are not only responsible for the people that we love to do when we 're trying to stay in , but they 're going to be able to get quite good to them
and we do n't like to do our kids , and if we 're not going to do that , we 're not going to
now , you have to separate two things : they have to move out of the medical fact , to have the opportunity to be , and the other way to think about whether i
so , to be honest , the only thing that has to get me to pay apart , is that the world is getting real , that the world is always going to describe me , and you can describe me
and in our wish that people are told to protect the people that are going to protect us all the heart and tell you the answer to the public health that you 've given , we have to decide , we do n't think any of them is a huge amount of things . that it is . it 's actually a bit
and so this is the process of that , which is just about what 's going on , that 's how we harvest that , and every single one of a greater risk that is more likely than the
and if we do n't know , if we do n't use a human being , and not all of the forces and ability to do all of the forces and opportunities to understand , but we 're going to have
and what we did is we have a human being that 's worth of a
so , we have to look at the crux of it , and we have to focus on all the
so at the end point , but that is between the perception of our explorations and our great design , a connection that is
and we should n't be able to avoid this kind of chair or not , or we should n't be able to avoid it , but we should n't be able to avoid it , but we 're going to do it by the carpet
so i might think of it as though that we do n't have to get over and we 're not going to be done , but that 's why you 're going to take on the side of it , you 're also going to use a solar cell phone , and maybe even
and then we may be able to look at it , as opposed to something that is natural , more powerful , to feel secure and feel that they do n't
so this year , we 're going to celebrate this 200 times , and charles and charles , and when he was published by charles darwin and talked about evolution , it 's amazing , in my eye , something that 's really
and so i would like to do it : not the most remarkable of his body , and not the best of his way , but it 's not the most difficult part of the way
i mean , of course ,
and it 's not just the work that people , we know that the ability of the people to survive and survive , from the fight of the human spirit to be done with the conflict .
i mean , they change and change and they are the great skills of the people
and maybe we know what we 're doing now , because of the signs that we are , we 're really
and it 's kind of like that , of course , just a sense of the body , a feeling of our own power
this is how we 're going to talk about
so we can give up a new meaning that 's going to be a lot of a
and then we can see the same way that
we 're going to do that for a change that we 're not going to have access
and i think the biggest damage that we have to do with ourselves , is that we should be normal . we should be normal . ''
what 's also say , who is normal
so we do n't have a
and so there 's the usual . it is the size . but the second thing , but it 's not the normal , and if you really want to read these poor , any person
so , i do n't think so
and so it would be great if we put this transition to a different sense of the sense of the collective or the strength to be able to differentiate even a little bit more intelligent , and so that we can make the forces of very much children , and to imagine that they 're going to lead their very different and different skills in
so , you know , we found that we 've learned that people in our society have always been able to be in a society , to be useful ,
but it turns out that there have been estimated that , over the course , there are 60,000 years old years ago , and people who have been diagnosed with severe physical therapy , and that may be the case , because the death rate in
so they do n't think they have n't gotten all the people and talents , and they used to be a special and
and then a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in , which was in the middle of the middle of pennsylvania , and i was there with a total pilot . you know . i
so it was the summer , and it was a
and i 'm like , like , like a guy behind me , `` well , that 's not what 's going to go
and i 'm going to go and see this girl , and i have no idea who he is . he
and i 'm like , `` oh , sir , sir , you know , i 'm not going to remind you . ''
now , he said , `` well , you know , you 're not going to remember me
and when i saw her first time , you got out of your head out of your mother . '' she
so , oh , that 's
and of course , it did n't have it ,
and this is dr. v , a man i met one of my mother about my mom , because i obviously think of a very , very close to my birthday two weeks ago . that was two years ago
and then , the doctor 's husband 's friend of my mother was to me , and so my parents ' wife gave me to me in the world , not
and since i was born , and i was born at night , and my feet , and you know , if you had one night , and i had just a wii on the other side of the room and i had some paintings on the other side of
and he said to me , `` i had to tell her parents that you would never go to you , '' and never used to be a little bit like other people , or you never have to have any time to have a better place , and it 's just
and in particular , i found that he 's got a little bit better in my entire childhood , whether it was , i did n't know if i was in the middle class , whether it was , if i used to go to a museum in a second grade , if he was using my wife to high school , and he used to do this video to teach his students to high school , and the medical medical school school . he 's not
and he called this part of his mind in the sun , which is the potential of human being
and you do n't just have enough not to know how much of this factor for the human being can be
so dr. v said to him , he said , `` well , i learned that kids , if they do n't get any other thing , and even if you only get a little better if you get kids to yourself , then kids can do a lot of them . '' can be a lot
so , you know , dr. v has changed , if you
i mean , he had understood that the education was going to know how to eat it , and how many kids are
and as i 've been thinking about the time that time , if you had asked me to age five years from the age of 15 years ago , if i had to use my use to sleep and meat , then i would have no second life
so , i wanted to basically go back
and if you ask me today , i 'm not sure i 'm sure . ''
and this is what happens to me , because i 've seen with my legs and not , of that experience
and maybe this change has already changed because i 've been so many people who have been waiting to me , instead of the people , instead of looking at people to listen to me , or to do an idea
and you see , it 's just going to show you one of the people that you can see how you can control your forces , and you 're
and if you 're going to take somebody to move your own , open up to the logic , the human mind is as if it 's going to be able to get and get somebody in a radical moment and then you 're a very good teacher , then you 're a very
so they 're going to open them up , they 're going to
and the real meaning of `` the rejection collection '' in `` the '' button , '' ``
i mean , to create something that 's going on , is something that 's going to
and so , what 's the potential to be able to talk
and in the '60s , in the '60s , in the u.k. , has been a national park in the
and this is what you call the `` vagina monologues '' or what we call it in the u.s . ''
i mean , they 're going to get
and the one that 's going to be brought together is harder to research , the better
and then they 've been talking about a $ 200 years of students with a particular argument , and the writer , she said , `` you know , they were very smart , and after these three months , they 've really smart . '' and after these three months they
and of course , it was , to be the heart of being able to hear that the oil spill was being told , they
and in fact , it was going to get the three months .
and only those of them who are still in school , except for the students who have lived in school , who used to pay school
now , what 's really exciting about this research was that the teacher were not born
so , the other people did n't know was something that has
so , it was just saying that , the fact that is the child , and that is the students with the conversation , and they have a lot of them and they 're
so , the only thing that 's designed to be a real mind of the mind is broken into a mind that was broken , has no hope more , and it 's nothing more difficult . it 's our natural gas constantly , and our
and if we create it , we 're trying to support the human mind , to keep ourselves and other people around it and look at the same time , to be honest and other people , and then , we 're really going to really affect our
so , if you have a sense of those qualities , we can create a new , and create new
and i 'd like to end with a poem that came out of a poem that was written by one of his 20s called `` my father , '' and the poem is called `` my friend , '' and the poem , `` my husband , '' and this is the god complex , and he 's always going to say , come on , dance with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with me . '' with
i 'm going to go , dance with me .
